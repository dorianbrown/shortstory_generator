 gats have really got up to the real problem. <newline> <newline> "Look, can you just make me some extra time please? I can help you right now." <newline> <newline> "But... but I'm busy right now! I must go get a good grip right now." <newline> <newline> "Are you really gon na go out for a walk like that?" <newline> <newline> "I'm not gon na... I need you to go out with me... because I want you to be there, right?" <newline> <newline> "Oh, yeah. You know how important this is. We should meet the President sometime in the future. What will you do?" <newline> <newline> "Right now we need to talk. You're gon na give me some... anything." <newline> <newline> "No, I'm not gon na leave now," said the President. <newline> <newline> "We have a very specific, strict policy on things that is not right now. I guess it is to be sure that what you say is right, is right and that's good. There's never an issue." <newline> <newline> The President put his hands on the table. "Now, what I like to do is... I've been in a lot of trouble. You know, I was trying to tell the public that I really didn't want one person... but, and I wanted to be sure, but the other people were so... upset." <newline> <newline> "Wait. The other guy that I've been trying to... to tell is my boss was not the right person... so, it *was* the other way around." <newline> <newline> The President smiled at his statement, feeling the President look a bit uncomfortable. <newline> <newline> "You know? You don't have to worry about it. You don't have to worry about me. You know what I mean. I don't have to worry about you right now, either. You can make the deal. Just let me... I promise." <newline> <newline> The president gave his hand a shake, and the President sat as the two stood on their own feet. <newline> <newline> "Listen, Mr. President. This is not going to be a problem. I'm going to make it happen. I get out the news. I get out... I get out the money. I get out that you're going to be there." <newline> <newline> In a final moment of silence, the President reached into his coat pocket to pull out a small watch. It was in his hand. <newline> <newline> "I get it, Mr. President. I'm done." <newline> <newline> The President reached out to grab the watch, and in that moment, his wife and their 2 daughters stood before the cameras on the White House lawn. The watch's face lit up in surprise. <newline> <newline> "You're on fire." <|endoftext|>
