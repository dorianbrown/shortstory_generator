As he died, it was his own face. <newline> <newline> His head was black and his hair was red. <newline> <newline> I don't think the time ever came. <newline> <newline> I look in my hands and I see a black hole and I turn back around and see an ancient, green, purple, green, green, green, all of these beautiful creatures. <newline> <newline> They were not that big or something, but some kind of flying creature. <newline> <newline> And it was like they were watching some sort of a movie. <newline> <newline> I sit up and I see one and it's big and I want to scream. <newline> <newline> "I am your son! I'm afraid you are dead! I'm scared I'm going to die because of the last thing I ever did!" <newline> <newline> We've been a couple days away from our final destination with this ship. <newline> <newline> They came in from all over the galaxy, all the way over the galaxy, all over the universe. <newline> <newline> And I'm not even sure how long we're going to go. <newline> <newline> I'm a small boy, a little boy, little kid. <newline> <newline> I can't even make out a few words. <newline> <newline> <newline> My head was burning, his head was red and his hair was purple. <newline> <newline> I stood there dumbfounded. <newline> <newline> For what was his last words I don't know. <newline> <newline> "My time is coming. My time is coming. My time is coming. My time is coming." <newline> <newline> I smile and let out a sigh. <newline> <newline> The boy and I are walking back to the ship and there's an old man. <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <|endoftext|>
