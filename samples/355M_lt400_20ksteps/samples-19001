[WP] When you turn 18 , you have to take the last quest in that game you have yet to play . This will involve you meeting your future spouse . As part of the quest , you must give them the equipment needed for their life . <|startoftext|> I took my time to wait for my 18th birthday to go through with . I had a life in front of me , a family waiting for my eighteenth . My friends were all waiting until they could get together to play the final match . My family looked at me with wonder and anticipation wondering how I was going to accomplish this quest . I stood there in front of me looking out over the faces of everyone that was there and it made me wonder what my life might be like to have that . For every child or son there are two that the first child wants to be with , those who are in need . With my 18th birthday coming to a close , I have to make a decision . Will I play this `` life '' and go to college ? A few of the older players do n't seem willing to play their 17 year old dreams . The last three teenagers had decided as part of their `` quest '' to get their 17 year old life together , as part of my quest it would be to take this `` quest '' to their 17 year old life . I knew I was only 18 , it was only 19 , I looked out over the faces of everyone on stage and realized why it was so important . Of all the options I thought , maybe I knew it would take me the best path . I stepped forward and put down my quest to complete the quest . <newline> <newline> In the ending of my quest , I reached out my hand and picked up a book I called *The Darkest Game* . As I closed the door I thought about all the people who would see me today , thinking the quest was complete . It was . <|endoftext|>
[WP] Write something with a happy ending . Except for the last sentence , of course . <|startoftext|> He sat atop his throne watching from afar . The light was all around him . Each man in particular watched from a distance , their fingers tracing the dark outlines that painted the landscape beneath him . <newline> <newline> No one would leave . This night was the final night . There was simply nobody to leave the throne room . It was not long before the other gods left as well . The heavens closed over him , and the earth parted to reveal a light , a single point of light . It reached out , and it did n't leave . But soon the light would be the only thing he knew . He would be nothing . It was time to make his departure . <newline> <newline> The light did not leave . It was not left . But it was found . He was caught by the light . He was left with the stars . The sky was still , but the stars shifted . The landscape faded , as everything in the sky faded . <|endoftext|>
[WP] Everyone on Reddit is actually a super hero with superpowers ; each power only enhances their power , as if it were a comic book . Write the end of the story . <|startoftext|> As I read through my Reddit account , I was struck by the realization that I 'd be posting in a super-hero subreddit . My name is /u/Syraphia - a hero whom I 'd never seen in writing before I posted this post . This was a new and very exciting concept , and one that I 'd love to take a post about . <newline> <newline> `` What does it mean ? '' I wondered , `` How do I get better at writing in Reddit ! '' <newline> <newline> After some research , I found a post that caught my eye . I thought , `` What this post and the rest of the post is teaching about me . Well , let 's see . '' <newline> <newline> A couple days went by and I began writing ; not only for this post , but for reddit itself . I 'm not sure how this is so simple but all these other threads , so much of them , are really good . I have quite a few of them [ here ] ( http : //www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/2cqm7y ? context=3 ) . And my username ? /u/Syraphia . <|endoftext|>
[ Wp ] I 'm an adulterer and I want to write a short story for my children . If you give me your time and permission , I 'll do as I want . <|startoftext|> A man with a bad temper and a knife in his pocket walks into the room with a shotgun in his hand and says , `` Look , baby , you have a lot
