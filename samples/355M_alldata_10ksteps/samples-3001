 `` <newline> <newline> `` My Lord ! The truth has reached me ! It 's coming ! '' <newline> <newline> `` That is why you must not die . When the time is right , you will come to this spot , and live the rest of your life again to take that first step in the path of happiness . '' <newline> <newline> `` But sir , '' muttered the other voice . <newline> <newline> `` Your future is coming soon and I ca n't be here for long . My body is aching to go . I will be gone with you soon . `` <newline> <newline> `` But , but , and you all can not live forever , your life will be long . After all , your first steps in the path of happiness are not always fun . We all know why you have to die , I have tried to live until now . You ca n't let go of our happiness anymore . '' <newline> <newline> `` But sir , we all know that I 'd rather die than spend my final 10 minutes with you . Why should they care ? Besides , '' smiled the voice . <newline> <newline> `` But sir , I know we were friends before we found out the truth about life . You are what I 'm here for , though I do n't want to remember this for the rest of my life because you were an adult and you did n't give any thought to it . I 'm here to keep you happy and I know what it is now . I know I will miss that . I know our days are often short and the memories are fleeting , but we can only hope it will happen . I know it will . We will look back on our last few years with wonder and be filled with hope . I know how it can feel knowing you live forever but I know not what it 's like to not have the memories . I do n't need them now . `` <newline> <newline> `` But , my Lord ! I did n't get to see you pass through the point of no return you had with life after childhood , my dear young boy . Today I see the end of your world . I can see the future with all of you and what lies before us . I know not just how long we have , but I see it . The world is at an end . When it ends it only leads me to it . I know not where I will return to but I think this is my fate . I know it 's far from perfect , but that 's not going to stop me . I know I have failed you all . I know I will fail you soon . I will fail my son . I know that I will fail you just like they did with so many others before me . But I choose not to die . Because we all have a future . So you can do whatever you want . I 'll see you all again . I 'll see you forever . I 'll see the future , the world I was hoping to see in just before I die . This is why you always wanted it to be . And I will take me one day for our journey . And I will see you take that first step in the path of happiness . But I know I wo n't be here . But I know I 'll come back , I promise you . I love you . <newline> <newline> - John '' <|endoftext|>

They all talk a lot . <newline> <newline> For their first gift i took my hand from my pocket and put it in my pocket . I then went down and looked at my hand . I felt so much love and the world gave me a gift . The world gave all of its gifts and I wanted it back and took away the gift from me and went up to tell all the other people who get gifted it so they get a chance to be good no matter if they are born or not . <newline> I was the first . <newline> <newline> And the world gave the gift to one last one . This one is one who made his/her first trip to the afterlife . <newline> <newline> I could make everyone happy . <newline> <newline> He/she has a beautiful house and a big family . Now when he/she goes up to the afterlife he/she stays in this room till all the other days . I could make everyone happy without hurting them . <newline> <newline> He/she has a nice old body and can talk just as well . <newline> <new
