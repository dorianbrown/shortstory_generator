======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 are all out of breath . `` Yeah , I have a bad day at work . '' <newline> <newline> The last sentence went on for a little while until he took my hand and led me to the bar and sat us down . The rest of the day was an uneventful one until I woke up and looked in his eyes . They was the most beautiful brown , the most beautiful green eyes i 'd ever seen . Then I looked at him . I mean , maybe a bit of a bit of a bit of a tad little bit of a wink . His smile was as deep as anyone could 've been in his life , and it broke the surface of all that pain and hatred and it took the wind of love right out of my hair . <newline> <newline> It 's a hell of a feeling , to see your soulmate get to the point where they can love each other and hate and love each other as if they can n't . They just love it more the better . It gave me goosebumps at the beginning , but it 's just part of being a vampire , and I love being a vampire . <|endoftext|>
[ IP ] The End <|startoftext|> I watched as the clouds went dark , the trees grew and the snow grew still less so . I was alone and I could n't breathe , and I felt my eyes closing . <newline> <newline> I could feel my ears starting to open , and the light was fading . <newline> <newline> The light from the fire started to fade . <newline> <newline> I could feel my heartbeat in my chest . <newline> <newline> The clouds went dark , the trees grew old and died . So did the fire . So did the sky . <newline> <newline> I was alone and I felt my life evaporate . <|endoftext|>
[WP] The world comes together when it stands still . <|startoftext|> I sat on the edge of the building I had lived in my whole life . The street was littered with discarded cardboard boxes stacked , the building seemed like it had never seen the light of day , but that must have been because of my surroundings . I would have called it derelict , even . Why did I let the light in my eyes blind me ? I did n't deserve such beauty . I knew I wanted it to last . How could I live without love ? Without care ? Even if I could n't be with the person I love , I did n't want to be caught in such an empty world . I could n't stand the pain of not having loved and was being hurt . But it did n't matter the way I felt like I already had when she started dating him . She was my best chance . Even if I could n't love her like the rest of society , it did n't matter , and she will never be hurt more than she already would have . She is more than that , she is my true love . A real girl , true and true . No more empty . No more lonely . No more lonely . I wish I was an alien . <|endoftext|>
[ IP ] A Night in the Woods <|startoftext|> *Shit , shit , * I thought as I looked across the clearing , at Muffet 's tree , a small , red tree in the distance . It was the night , as far as I could tell . There was no real sound , but there was a sound of trees and a clear night sky . I was scared , really scared at that moment . What could I do ? I stared at the trunk , my eyes darting left and right across the clearing at nothing in particular . I knew I would not be able to walk through it in the night , without something much worse than an ear-tape and a flashlight . I pulled my face back into the tree , and looked over my shoulder as I ran . When I was in my pj 's and drinking , the sound that had been there for a split-second was gone . I looked up , to try and see the other , but I saw nothing . Then , I heard it again , that big *whoosh* that the wind used to make of it . I stood there for a moment and looked at Muffet . She was staring at me , her face lit up by the light I looked at . <newline> <newline> `` What are you doing in there ? '' I asked to her , her soft voice echoing through the clearing , `` you should be in your home , not here , with me . You were supposed t- '' . Before I could finish , she threw down what was once a large , red tree branch . With a sudden , this branch ripped off and broke through the branches of what I was looking at . The light that I was looking at
