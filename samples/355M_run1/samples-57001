 <newline> <newline> He stopped mid-stride with a sharp 'G-H-A ' , and let his legs do a complete somersault on a hill . `` No , '' he said with a grin , but it 's not the most reassuringly cheerful tone ! He took another deep breath , his mind wandering through the possibilities . He could go back to his house and hang out now and then , but he was n't going to stick around in that place anymore . He 'd make himself more comfortable at a coffee shop . <newline> <newline> It was dark , and he did n't quite hear the door open . There was a noise from his right and a familiar *click* echoed down the path . <newline> <newline> His hand darted out to his side as he heard footfalls coming from under the heavy rock . He was about to turn and see if she followed the sound , but suddenly silence . He shifted , his mind back to the present . <newline> <newline> He looked into the hole . There was someone there , but that was n't it , there was something behind him . He felt his heart race a bit before he realized - his hand was moving . He spun around , his teeth grit as he stared - no , it was someone coming after him . <newline> <newline> But that was n't it , there was something bigger . More... <|endoftext|>
[WP] There are three things all wise men fear : the sea in storm , a night with no moon , and the anger of a gentle one . Write a story about one or more of these . <|startoftext|> They say a king is not born brave , a princess was born a fool . <newline> <newline> The sea is cruel , as the waters turn black with the waves . The moon is a dim reminder of where the sun has gone but never shines enough . The moon is a blank thing , and the stars are a reminder of where ever there was a sun , but never shone enough . <newline> <newline> He is born in a kingdom , of love and peace . He is always surrounded in family â€“ he is the oldest child , the bravest of us all . To be honest he can never quite make friends . When he does , he is n't there , hiding , waiting for his parents to return . They always return before he left . <newline> <newline> He is n't allowed in his parents room , but his parents know . But he could always sneak in when he wanted to . He could always sneak in when they were n't looking . He could always sneak in when he needed to be alone . <newline> <newline> The nights are the worst , spent alone against the sea . Alone he can feel the weight of his fear . He thinks of the old woman , who would have screamed , but not now . The sea was so close but when she came he could never escape . I hope he can hide his fear now - I hope he can sleep soundly with her beside his bed . I hope he can know how much pain and hurt he still feels . I hope his fears will get a little less and that he can sleep in peace and content . <newline> <newline> The nights are even more deadly than the sea . The moon , even more powerful now . He thinks he can see the moon as it comes closer and closer to being full . But the moon is still there , a shadow in the darkening night . He has been playing with it ever since he can remember , and ever since he could remember his fears have gotten stronger . Perhaps that will be his true nature . Perhaps he will come out to her and tell her about the terror he feels and if she is the same he has never felt before . <newline> <newline> Maybe so , but only if he lets it go . His body still trembles . My stomach is churning because of the dread he feels inside it . His fears are n't so bad anymore . I hope he can sleep soundly with his princess in his arms , and that he can feel her arms wrap around him and bring him to a safe place . I hope he can forget not to be afraid . I hope he can have happiness forever . <newline> <newline> His wife does n't understand . She loves him , but she can never understand . It is n't long until we have to face our demons , and only then can we truly be free . <newline> <newline> `` I do n't want to go out today , '' he said . The words felt heavy in his throat , choking him . He was sure it was a lie , even though his fear was obvious . But his wife did n't know . She came rushing home last night , crying a little at the door . He could n't leave
