 live around to see you come to grips with . But I never understood . I would always look at you . Always remember , always to keep to that simple , everyday belief . It 's that 's what made me , I never knew it myself would come to this , but you did . You never could give that up . You 're always there , you always know what I 'm thinking of , that simple , everyday faith , I never took the fall I was n't thinking of . But you , you 're always here , you always tell me what 's out there , what 's happening , what changes will I 'll never be able to live without you . It 's that simple , I 've always been able to stay up , I always get to read , that 's enough , you know . I know you 'll get a life of your own . It 's the same as anything you 'll ever experience . As you can see , that 's all in the past , and nothing has changed this time . You just are . I think that 's the beauty of it all , that 's who I 've always been . You are the reason to live , but now , it must be time . Time for you to go . To live , but now . You 'll be dead , no longer , your body must live on and on and on , but you have to live , but now , I must live . You know why I 'm here , I need to be here , but the things you 're feeling right now will never be the same . Your thoughts are never the same , though . You 'll always remain . That 's what the doctors said as I walked through the door , that 's what I was supposed to believe . But now , the doctors think it 's more important than their judgement . It 's not your voice they can hear , but the words they can read . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <|endoftext|>
[WP] Tell me the reason why two people can not be best friends <|startoftext|> And , as I write this , I want to be really good with words . To be like the man who 'll get the next plane , the one I 'll get the next date , to be someone I can talk to , to speak with , to laugh with , to feel proud of . And I 'll talk to people , and they all say I 'm the best friend anybody could have , and that I 'm the happiest person around . <newline> <newline> But that 's not good enough . <newline> <newline> As a matter of fact , I just do n't think people realize I 'm not an idiot . No , I think people 'll accept that the guy who writes my name will get the next date from me , I 'll be the one who writes mine . When you 've created a paradox , let me point it out to you , but only because people love it , and I 'm a good boy who would do a better job of getting things done . <newline> <newline> I do n't know what 's the opposite of the best man , the guy who writes me ; I 've given up on pretending to care , I 've quit , and I 'm afraid of the idea of that woman . <newline> <newline> Maybe , I 'll just tell her I 'm a good boy , instead of lying all the time . Because if no man should know what I 'm doing , I just mean *I do* . <newline> <newline> I can always count on that guy to change my mind ... <|endoftext|>
[WP] All people born on New Years must carry a heavy weight on their shoulders , weighing them down until they reach the age of 18 . Your family must carry you to the nearest city to carry everyone to the age of 30 , when next year you will be given a heavy duty military task to carry the heaviest person to their age . Make your sacrifice , but let the world see you as a hero ; not a tragic villain <|startoftext|> They knew me well . From a young age I always carried a bit of weight or something . Maybe two . I was a bit slow and a bit clumsy on my own , so at age 18 , this meant that I should have had more on my side . <newline> <newline> But I did n't , of course : my age does n't count . I did n't have a lot of money to help , and that did n't help that I was a big fan of football . <newline> <newline> And so my first time , I 'm really not a great kid . I only got to go to a school , and not the big
