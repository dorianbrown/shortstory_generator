, I'll never, ever let him be like that. <newline> <newline> "Sir, there's a situation of..." the radio was interrupted, as it's last two masters hung on for another day at the table. <newline> "Sir, if one of them thinks that I'm going to try to hurt that mother fucker's eyes... I'll break out of there!... We never will again!" <newline> <newline> But even as he tried to say that one thing, I couldn't say that one thing. I knew that I could use whatever was inside that little thing. I also knew that if it would hit me, that it would hit me... it would hurt. <newline> <newline> "Yes, Sir, yes... what would you ask of me?" <newline> <newline> This time, I wouldn't have to use my own word, but for the first time I could make it sound easier. <newline> <newline> "You'll get the best possible treatment, Mr. Sanders. And the best chance. When is everything going to be fixed? When can we get the best deal?" <newline> <newline> I heard the last transmission on the line, then it was off to the side. I turned back away. <newline> <newline> Suddenly I saw the doctor's face. She looked more concerned than shocked by his face. <newline> <newline> "Mr. Sanders, the... treatment is working. Can you call me over?" <newline> <newline> Without skipping a beat I pressed the control button, and the room came to life. The doctor looked up, and he looked at the nurse. <newline> <newline> "Mr. Sanders, do you see..." <newline> <newline> "I'm not sure what to be on here. I do feel the effects, Sir." <newline> <newline> "Sir, sir, what'd you say?" <newline> <newline> "The last time he was hurt, he managed to save his mother... so he'd... like... hurt her, he..." <newline> <newline> "Sir?" <newline> <newline> "Yes, Sir." <newline> <newline> I looked at the nurse again. <newline> <newline> "He... he... he... he would... he would hurt..." <newline> <newline> And then there was silence. <|endoftext|>
[WP] You are part of a resistance against your masters . One day , an executioner cuts a hand . With a single motion , the hand disappears . <|startoftext|> It was a brutal beating, blood splattering onto the grass and the floor. The guard dragged the prisoner back to his cell where he kept screaming out orders through a loudspeaker. I followed closely behind, staring at the white board that the executioner had cut. He looked at me with a sad face and an expression of shock. His face was a deep mask of a man, his face had his eyes and a cold, sad look in his eyes. I followed him to the floor, then I came to the same cell another one of the guards had just executed. <newline> <newline> I was there when it happened. I was sitting quietly in a small box in the middle of the forest when the torture started. I was walking along the forest path when I felt something grab my hand. I turned around to see that something was blocking my head. I turned around and saw that something was holding it up. I quickly run into the clearing. My knees are bent, and my right wrist hangs out on one of the guards legs with no resistance. I stand to my right while I hear the guards yelling in unison :'YOU! YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE KILLED ' <newline> <newline> The guard runs into the clearing. He stands up and walks over to my side of the body. He tells me to put the body on the ground. I do so with a knowing look as I stand and run my leg over to the guard. The guard tells me that I was killed for the rebellion, and the guards are holding him accountable for what they do. After his sentence, his head was on me, and he then spoke softly :'I am not here to punish the king. I am here to serve you. I am here to serve my people. ' <|endoftext|>
[WP] One morning you discover that humanity is the destroyer of worlds . <|startoftext|> It was a pretty simple thing, I had never been part of anyone's life. A lot of people had never realized that the "goddess", as she was called, wasn't really a human. A little
