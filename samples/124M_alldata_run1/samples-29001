[WP] In 1943 a war has begun between the Allies against the Axis . They exchange everything they have and warms up many Years later . The Second World War ends . <|startoftext|> In 1945 , a war has begun between the Allies against the Axis . The two sides have been at war with each other for decades , but it looks like they have no idea how to get by . One side sends in its top brass and a dozen other top brass on a boat , that is one of the many transports for the Allied . The Axis navy is equipped and ready to meet their needs . A few years later , however , the people of the Allied countries come to an agreement : that the Axis people should get one thing right this time : <newline> <newline> 1 ) that their needs can be met by mutual action and that they should treat each other with equal respect from the beginning of creation . <newline> <newline> 2 ) That one specific task , the task of making sure that they and the Allied forces arrive in time to end this time , of trying to avoid a war and of trying to prevent the Allied forces from reaching the Axis , and of trying to ensure that our allies are ready to fight back . It is imperative that we make sure that we do it . <newline> <newline> 3 ) That I have had time to reflect on the events . <newline> <newline> 4 ) I know we just made a mistake , but do n't let it end there . <newline> <newline> 5 ) I have had time to reflect on the accomplishments and hopes and dreams that the Allies have achieved . I know that in 1945 , we made something like a third world war and it has been difficult for us to get used to it , but it is a victory . I can tell you right now that we did . <newline> <newline> 6 ) We are going to go to war , the reason why we went into war is because in 1945 , the Allies gave us enough weapons to defend ourselves . <newline> <newline> 7 ) This war seems so much like a fantasy . <newline> <newline> 8 ) I know it seems silly but we are going to be there for the Allies until they come for us . <newline> <newline> 9 ) We are going to live . For decades , we have been searching for one thing that will bring us back . <newline> <newline> 10 ) If you love this story of ours , I am your brother and I am your father . <newline> <newline> Goodbye , Adolf Hitler . <newline> <newline> <|endoftext|>
[ CW ] Take the most underhanded plot ( `` The Woods ) you can , make it very dark , dramatic and emotionally compelling . <|startoftext|> The woods are so different . <newline> <newline> I do not know what the forest is ; only I know how to hunt . The forest is so much smaller and lighter than I can ever find it . I see the trees all around me , some of which were once forested and some of which were once undergrowth . <newline> <newline> I do not know why all these things move so rapidly and how they seem to sway like a fog . The leaves on my feet dance around as I climb high enough to climb higher and higher every day . <newline> <newline> The water in the pond is so hard and heavy and cold . The water is always so cold and cold and so wet . The trees and the bushes sway all around me and all around me . <newline> <newline> I know that the wind is so strong that I can not see its body nor can I see its face . I can feel its voice . <newline> <newline> I know that the light that shines through my curtains protects it from the darkness that comes from the sky . I know it smells good and has such a long time to develop . I know it knows me and knows me even as I am in the middle of the forest and I know it does . <newline> <newline> I am a different beast . I am not a great beast and not a great one , I am a small one . But that does not matter . For the forest is alive and growing all around me . <newline> <newline> I am not a beast and I am not a great one . But if
