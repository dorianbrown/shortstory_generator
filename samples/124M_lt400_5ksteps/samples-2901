 don't feel so guilty about it . I was so glad to be a part of this new society and finally have an open space to do so '' <newline> <newline> `` Oh right , that 's great . I hope the rest of the world can finally have a space to live out their nights with the rest of us '' <newline> <newline> `` Hey ... I 'd like to tell you something '' <newline> <newline> `` Ah , you just have to understand that we can be better people if we just keep it going '' <newline> <newline> `` I always try to say the word 'better ' when discussing our problems with our neighbors '' <|endoftext|>
[WP] Describe a small object , but make the most ridiculous pun-sounding description you can . <|startoftext|> They had me . They 'd have me at school one day . When they looked at me I would sit beside them and wave . We laughed at them but they 'd laugh back with the same enthusiasm I always had . I do wonder what could be done since I never asked them to go back and get me . It did n't seem real to me now that I 'm sitting in front of them . So I left them to wonder what they should do about the way they treat the dead I 've left . <newline> <newline> Now their time to treat me is past , and I ca n't help but feel the dread of the rest of my life , they say . I had been raised to believe that life only lasts so long , and I was right . I could go on and on . The ones who would talk , those who 'd make love and give me the money . They called that the good life and it would continue until they left . But that is how things are , you know . Not always with the right person or setting of eyes . I just want to feel the dread of a lifetime . <|endoftext|>
[WP] Your mommy/foey wo n't let you go and just leave you alone . <|startoftext|> She had a point . I was too late for that but she 'll have to know I 'm in a situation for which I will take her in a heartbeat , it 's better than staying on my own . I 'll tell her , a 'she ' and she 's got a bit to do though . I can handle this . <newline> <newline> I can , however , tell a little girl who has never been to my house and has n't visited my house for years she is too scared . <newline> <newline> I can say with my voice , `` That I ca n't help you '' . <newline> <newline> She is no longer scared by the voices of strangers , she will be scared by me too . <newline> <newline> I know you will be too . <newline> <newline> She 'll be happy if she gets the chance to speak with me again . She 's never done so well , but she is in love with me and she 'll never be afraid to share anything with me . <newline> <newline> I 'm scared just to tell her that she 'll probably enjoy this . <|endoftext|>
[WP] You find a dead body in a suburban house . Thinking your old habits are gone , you grab the body . But the murderer is not a ghost looking for evidence at all and you realize he was just as old as you . The ghost is actually not a ghost looking for evidence , he is simply a zombie looking for evidence . <|startoftext|> `` ... Nooooo ! '' I yell in fear from the shadows . The last time I checked was around the age of 30 . '' `` ... you 're late ! '' the killer yells `` Nooooo , what 's up ? '' I ask . I look at the bodies now dead dead body , and as I look at I hear screaming , footsteps of a boy and a man . The man says , `` Hey boy ! I 'll stop in here '' . I look back , and I hear a whisper , a boy , walking up to me . I look , and then I see it : <newline> <newline> `` Nooooo ! '' I scream as I run to my kitchen . Nooooo , nooooo , nooooo . The screaming continues ... <|endoftext|>
[WP] Make a list of your favorite song lyrics that would make a bad teacher 's morning routine . <|startoftext|> I wish I could go outside and just go to sleep . <newline> <newline> I wish I could go outside and just get drunk with this guy all night . <newline> <newline> <newline
