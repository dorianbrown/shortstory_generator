[ CW ] Get me hooked in 150 words or less . <|startoftext|> How could the darkness have been so bad ? I have never been afraid of death , not during my life . I 'm a man who never goes out , a man who never has a father . In the darkness of night and in the warmth of day I am a man who lives for nothing more than the fleeting comfort of his mother , my only family , my only love . I can even see through the blackness of the night . <newline> <newline> I do n't believe in God , or any supernatural thing , but sometimes I think about the things I 'd do if I had not lived . I 've lived life and I 've never been afraid . There 's no point in worrying where it may take me , so I know I wo n't be going out for long . <newline> <newline> The darkness is too bad for me , no matter how I try to smile at it . It 's sad , it feels sad , but it 's also the only thing I want to be happy about . No matter how I try to stop it . That 's the only thing I want to remember . <|endoftext|>
[WP] Two suicidal people happen to meet on the same bridge to jump . Rather than jumping , they jump on the other side . Describe their conversation . <|startoftext|> `` We jump to jump to the other side . '' <newline> <newline> I know I can do this better than any of my friends and family think I am . I know I can do this better than anyone else in the world . <newline> <newline> We did it a little before , for a short amount of time . The only reason I ever really care about this is so I have to stay up for the whole event . `` It 's a lot of fun . '' The only reason I ever thought something like this would leave me with that much was because my plan and plans were what happened when I jumped . They all ended pretty quickly though , so we were left with the options I 'm going to leave at midnight , which is the only time in the entire world I need to say goodbye . <|endoftext|>
[WP] The hero of the story does n't realize that he 's the villian . <|startoftext|> He saw the woman as she was crossing the street , his heart beat and blood pumped like a million river . I stood tall and took a deep breath , knowing all the risks he put the life of an innocent person . I grabbed my coat and headed into the night . <newline> <newline> `` I 'll be with you soon '' I shouted as I headed my way into the alley . My heart beat slowed to a halt , but I did n't care , after all we had done all the good work for him , why do n't we just stop fighting this is what mattered most . `` You look so tired today . '' I could see from my tone that I was already too exhausted to answer the women calling out to me . `` I know that the girl in front of you was trying to get out of the way , but you just can not see it , it 's too late . '' My heart slowed again to a low beat . I could not look away . I turned around to see who she is , but I did n't see anybody . I could see the look in her eyes . Then I froze , all I saw was that tired expression that he had as he saw it every time we met . A look that said , `` She 's gone now , why , why ? '' And that was the last time I saw her . <|endoftext|>
