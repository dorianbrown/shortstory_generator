 head of his long black coat . <newline> <newline> `` Sir ... '' , he begins , but there is no need to hurry in the truth as he looks the face he saw in his dreams , that face that had taken his heart out all his life . It was that face that had said that you could do no wrong , that you should be happy in what you did . <newline> <newline> `` Sir ... '' the man stops again , tears slowly climbing on his face . `` I am sorry , there are certain mistakes I 'll never forgive . '' <newline> <newline> `` Sir ... '' , the man says , his voice cracking , his voice cracking , his throat dripping blood . His breath slows and his skin tenses , his lips quivering and shaking , it was like they were twitching . The man shakes his head in shock . He could never forgive this man , but he ca n't let the hatred of someone like him hurt any of his brothers ever again . <newline> <newline> `` Sir ... '' He looks at me , `` I know . I know . I do n't know why . '' <newline> <|endoftext|>
[ PI ] The Last Ship : An Untitled Story <|startoftext|> I do n't have a lot to say about the book . I did n't find it very challenging , the plot just felt too rushed and it 's overall pacing is n't too great either ; however , there 's a story in the back which I could actually enjoy , thanks to what they are going for . <newline> <newline> The main point of the story is the ship moving towards the nearest star with a large laser on board , with an unknown vessel in the distance . <newline> <newline> The spaceship appears on the radar as the beam comes closer , but it is n't the ship ; it 's a hologram that appears when it crosses the range of detection . <newline> <newline> It 's only after the craft crosses the range to reach the star that I notice it . The artifact , that 's what he 's talking about is a computer program that has a program in it , which has been running a program since the middle of the first century B.C.E . However , a program was found in the ship 's ship 's core in the first twenty-seventh century A.E . It has been running for almost two thousand years , and has found a program written into a computer in its core . <newline> <newline> However , the main part of the program , which has a program named `` Program : Scanner '' is designed to have only one purpose , namely the purpose of keeping track of objects with mass of five kilons . It does this by scanning the universe through hyperspace radio waves to determine what properties a given object has . <newline> This is n't very useful . For one thing , the only properties that can be used ? <newline> <newline> It 's unclear what is inside the object , but it 's quite possible there 's something , like an engine , that runs on fuel , which is also not necessary for any sort of vehicle . <newline> <newline> It ca n't be . There is no object which could possibly exist in a five kilon radius with only one engine , and this object would be impossible . <newline> <newline> I do n't see why there could n't simply not have a ship , even if the author had some way of describing it , since the concept could never really be used . <newline> <newline> The writer simply does n't mention what object is on the alien vessel , and never mentions that there are weapons on the ship , which is a problem because a ship could n't possibly have weapons . But I 'm more worried about what the aliens do , and to that end I have two concerns . <newline> <newline> If the alien race has some sort of sentient intelligence , it might have some sort of artificial intelligence , but they should n't be so easily fooled by anything like that . The humans would probably attempt to communicate by writing on their own minds , with no effect . I have a strong suspicion , however , that they might at some point have been able to fool them in the past via a process known as quantum teleportation , which would allow them to see their own minds for as long as they were human and would allow them to manipulate their memories at will . <newline> <newline> In particular , the aliens would devise a way to see themselves through only their human minds . The human mind would then be manipulated into something else , like some sort of mind control for intelligent AI . This should lead us to the conclusion that aliens did n't originate from the stars , but they were created through an outside force .
