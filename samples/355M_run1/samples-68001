 his long nose and a smirk plastered on his lips . “ Now you understand . I can only help you at your home . But no matter ! Even if I knew how a real man works , I ’ d still be forced into a world of chaos and destruction . I can not live with myself as a result of my actions now. ” <newline> <newline> <newline> The man looked in shock of the information . He was a real , flesh-and-blood human , and I could have sworn that it was him and the first human in a decade- “ Please , I ’ m very sorry about me doing this to you . I ’ m here for you and you know it. ” His hand began to tremble . “ Just calm down. ” <newline> <newline> The girl stared me down and then turned off the man with a glare , still standing just at the edge of line of the large room . Her eyes were wide , ready to burst at the slightest provocation . I knew that , but she couldn ’ t . I gave a few more steps , and watched her in front of her until my back stood up . She walked out , looking just as shocked and hurt as I was . “ You can not take me now ! ” She yelled . <newline> <newline> I looked at her , still silent . “ Well , at least you don ’ t call me you bastard . But I will . And at your home I shall. ” <newline> <newline> I let my hand drop , turning to him to begin walking away . “ Just be sure you don ’ t kill him to save me . Not without a reason . ” <newline> <|endoftext|>
[WP] You move into a haunted house , hoping to make friends , when you first see the ghost . <|startoftext|> `` This was the last time I bought one of these , '' I thought . I 'd moved into this old house to buy one of these haunted house things but when I bought it , it just had n't been that good . It was a little big , I 'd just moved it from the attic into the basement when I moved in to clean up , and it was a bit creepy but nothing else . Still , I thought it was probably for the best and that it could be a good scare , so I did n't really mind it . <newline> <newline> `` What 's your name ? '' I asked . <newline> <newline> `` I think your brother called me by my first name , '' she said behind her back . I could hear her walk towards the corner of the room and I felt a bit worried that something just had gone wrong . She 'd been there for quite awhile . `` Do you know who he is ? ? '' She asked . I 'd always heard her talk when I came here . `` I do n't think I can really remember who called me , but I think it 's a ghost . '' It was a ghost I 'd never heard before , but she did n't seem to have any reason for coming here . <newline> <newline> I thought for a second about it , then I nodded . It 's hard to be haunted when you ca n't talk to anybody . `` Good night to you . '' She just straight faced me and she 'd wink back , then run off , right out the door . I had taken it a bit harder to move into since she did n't come back , but the house had been so nice . I just hope I 'll see her again one day , maybe if I can get her to come back . I 'd still be haunted . *Oh well , I just need to find some supplies* I think . <newline> <newline> `` Do n't forget about the money , '' I said . She just glared at me and walked back into the house . I was n't sure what to expect when she went back . I had a feeling it was just the first step . Maybe I would just talk to some people . <newline> <newline> `` Alright , '' I said . `` What 's your name again ? '' <newline> <newline> `` I think mine is Charlie . '' <newline> <newline> She walked over to me and said , `` Charlie ? He 's kind of a funny old dog . '' I was a little confused and she chuckled instead . It was my name too . Charlie must have walked in my house . She had gone to check if I was home , but after a moment I realized that she was a dog . I asked her to come to me , she had said yes , but there was no way I was going back . I decided I should keep her here until I figure some more on
