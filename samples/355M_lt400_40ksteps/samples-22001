[WP] The world just learned the name `` The One Eyed Man '' <|startoftext|> <newline> <newline> The world just learned the name `` The Man '' . <newline> <newline> The day the world finally came to learn the name `` The One Eyed man '' , the world was in awe . The scientists and theologians and scholars all over the world cried out in terror . The world was in awe , but for some reason they were n't in awe of the name . They were all speechless . <newline> <newline> The world was in awe of the name . All of it did was feel it . All of it was in awe of the name .

We knew that it is impossible that God will give us the name `` The One Eyed Man '' , and that we are meant to live in peace forever . We know we are meant to live in peace forever . <|endoftext|>
[WP] We 've arrived at the end of the world . At the end of time . The universe is finally coming to an end . There has been a great tribulation in the world , as we saw the rise and fall of the great empires , the fall of the Great Wall , and the rise of the Islamic State .

There will be no more cold . There will be no more poverty , because everyone will live on the land . There will be no conflict . There will be no need for one . <newline> <newline> In the centre of the ocean there is an underground city .

The end of all things and their own end may be the last word on earth , for many generations of people , from millions of years ago , will be forgotten , and when they are no longer remembered , in the end , there will be nothing . But their end will not be the end . There will be nothing . <|endoftext|>
