He took a deep gasping breath , and slowly opened his mouth . A voice from all around him , from the men who did n't hurt him , yelled `` This will kill you ! '' A cold breeze blew through the door . Another cold breeze blew through the window . <newline> <newline> The young man and the man on the ground started talking . They looked at each other for a long time . They looked at eachother , and when the man on the ground grabbed the microphone and shouted `` Welcome to the United States of America '' , the old man dropped to face in shame . <newline> <newline> The young man opened his mouth . The boy could n't believe the boy was on the ground , and the boy . The boy was a boy . It was n't fair , he thought . This would kill him . He knew he should n't try to stop the wind .

[WP] You are a hero who has been in this world before and you come back every time you die . You have now been reincarnated through the portal , and a new hero is out on the scene , and you 're trying to convince your self to not relive . <|startoftext|> I 'm not the world 's best writer , so I wrote it on mobile , so I 'll finish it off later ! <newline> <newline> <newline> I 'm the new Hero of the People . I 'came back from the cold , the cold wind , with no fire to warm me up . Just me and the cold air . <newline> <newline> I 'm a little different than the other heroes I came back with . All I 've ever done is stand around and point . That 's pretty much my best selling thing . Even though the other heroes have no fire , I managed to survive in the snow of this land . <newline> <newline> I 've only used fire once during this snowbound world since I got here , and it was to try and stop the warlord from killing my people when I found them . <newline> <newline> It 's been a whirlwind of life , I 've watched friends die and family bleed . <newline> <newline> I 've spent tons of money , my savings . <newline> <newline> When he was born again , I tried everything .

I had left my mother alone for a decade before today , she was n't supposed to pick up anymore . <newline> <newline> <newline> In all honesty , my mother had thought that my father was the reason for the change. For all of my efforts , he was n't ready for this ! The time was up , my father was gone , and as she had said I was the only living memory in my family . <newline> <newline> <newline> I would never love more . All the struggles , all the pain . The loneliness . The isolation from humanity . <newline> <newline> <newline> I just could n't imagine it could 've come at any time ! <newline> <newline> <newline> My mother and I were watching the clock on the kitchen wall . It was one hour until the meeting started to begin , two hours and twenty-five minutes . <newline> <newline> <newline> My father is gone , and I 've finally succeeded . A miracle !
