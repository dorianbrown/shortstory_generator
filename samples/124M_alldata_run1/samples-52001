 up as a group of two or three teenagers <newline> <newline> *They went at the school shooting , only to be killed as you watched* <newline> <newline> *You remember the sound that followed the car on fire down the highway . That was you . * <newline> <newline> *You remember the smell of blood and burned rubber , the ache you felt as you walked home . * <newline> <newline> *You remember the taste of it . * <|endoftext|>
[WP] Write a story with as many contradictions as possible . <|startoftext|> She never even saw you . <newline> She was only a man from a small town in the Midwest and he only had one girl as a daughter . She had been a prostitute once and now she had to hide her true profession for fear of being executed by the local sheriff . <newline> <newline> But that was alright . <newline> <newline> She saw you every day , but she never knew you were a serial killer . <newline> <newline> That 's just how you found her - the one of her own choice , the one she trusted most . <newline> <newline> This was how you found your way into the life of your victim : you would have a little girl at a time of your choosing . <newline> <newline> But there was only one boy . Just the one . That 's why she said the name as you turned to walk back to your car . But he was n't there . His name was Steve . Well , there was no way to be sure . But Steve was the one you knew by chance to be the one you know by heart . <newline> <newline> I think I may have just met him when he was a young girl in a small , remote town in the middle of nowhere . <newline> <newline> I did n't know what to think . It was one of those situations : Steve never knew the man you were going to find . Or that he knew the girl that the one of the girl in the trailer lived with . <newline> <newline> It was an empty parking lot with nothing but a few empty cars in the back . She was just standing on a pile of clothes , looking into the street in the dark . <newline> <newline> Steve was n't there . This was going to be an entirely different story . <|endoftext|>
[WP] A man walks into a bar after a long day at work . He finds that he no longer knows the bartender 's identity , but he is still vaguely aware that he is still drunk at the bar . <|startoftext|> `` I ca n't believe I walked in here ! '' I exclaimed . <newline> <newline> `` What ? '' The bartender asked <newline> <newline> `` The bartender is dead , '' I explained <newline> <newline> `` Yeah there is a man who lives here . '' <newline> <newline> `` The bar must have some kind of bar or something ! He was here when the bartender was dead . '' <newline> <newline> `` Where did the door go ? '' I asked . <newline> <newline> `` The door is still hanging open , '' he said while holding a key against it with a key ring . <newline> <newline> `` And that 's it ? '' This must have been my first day in the bar . <newline> <newline> `` There is but the key . '' <newline> <newline> `` Did you open it ? '' <newline> <newline> `` It ca n't be ... . '' <newline> <newline> `` There was a door ? '' <newline> <newline> `` No ... '' <newline> <newline> `` So what happened there ? '' <newline> <newline> `` The door is still on . '' <newline> <newline> `` But you just said it . And here it is . '' <newline> <newline> `` And you are the bartender ? '' <newline> <newline> `` The one I knew from the night . '' <newline> <newline> `` Well that ca n't be the case now can it ? I 'm so drunk my brains are killing me '' <newline> <newline> `` You think I am the barman .
