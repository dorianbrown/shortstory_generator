 once for your life." <newline> <newline> <newline> He looks around then back to the window as if he could see into the distance. <newline> <newline> <newline> What he's looking at is not a man, or at least not a man looking far, but is a boy. He's not any of them, he's two feet tall, and no nose. In his left hand is a very thin, almost-pouched nose, which makes the name *Tom* somewhat embarrassing. His right hand is his right hand, not on the left, he's on the left - and he has no nose. <newline> <newline> <newline> His right hand is, what appears to be a very thin, almost-pouched-smile man, right hand is now, and it has the same nose. In his left hand are two little-finger nails. <newline> <newline> <newline> He hasn't moved his head but instead has a little-finger-splayed-finger-finger ( two fingers in front and one finger behind it ) nose. <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> He is looking at something in particular, in this case two different things. His head is tilted slightly to the left slightly. His head is now right back. His nose is pointed towards the window, but does not move. <newline> <newline> <newline> The nose is not just one nose to go around either. It is the entire nose. If you touch it directly, you can now hear the sound of a voice. The voice does not speak but it is there now. <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> The nose is also, for some reason, pointed towards the window, so what he's seeing through the window, is directly in front of him. The nose now is pointed into his hands and now they're both just fingers. He's now an upright, upright, upright, upright - and, from inside the window, he now has a full-face grin. <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> "Good day. Get your work in." <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> He smiles and sits down next to him, and they look at each other for a minute and a half. For several minutes, the other looks at him without expression, then at him without expression, and then at him through the window, and then back to the window once they realize that a man doesn't have a nose. <|endoftext|>
[WP] Write a journal entry of yourself or some other existing or fictional character ( I 've given you one of these characters before ) <|startoftext|> Dear Diary, <newline> <newline> This isn't exactly what I had thought. It was all I could think on my end. As the years have gone by, I have lost many memories and have learned much. I don't think any of this will be the last, but for now, I have to think of something different. In the future, I would write this again and again and keep my journal. I hope things will get better as time goes on, and that I can find the one that is the best. <newline> <newline> *July 4th, 2018* <newline> <newline> Dear Diary, <newline> <newline> There have been a lot of great things. I've grown up with a handful of my friends since then, and I'm still trying to get used to most of them. This journal hasn't lost it's life, though. This journal is full of great places. I know I've written this before, but my mind hasn't always been one to write it and keep away what is on the page. If it hasn't changed too much recently, I'm sure I can write it anyway. <newline> <newline> *June 14th, 2017* <newline> <newline> I've spent most of 2016 year working with my therapist. He has been a good therapist and has made my life much easier and had a lot of fun. He used to work several years ago, and I used to love it. It's really not what I would call fun, but it has helped get through what I had. My therapist loves writing that journal as well. <newline> <newline> *May 3rd, 2017* <newline> <newline> Dear Diary, <newline> <newline> I want to write to your son about the great book, "Dogma". We went on a trip to the museum that was set to open next year and I wanted to let him have some pictures of dogs, because they were
