 mad a woman , for I have killed many men and women throughout my time as a soldier , this was no different . <newline> <newline> I was told to write this in my journal . The man I thought of was a soldier who lost his way . Some of you who are n't dead yet would read this again . If you find this and are still alive , please do n't kill me . Now then , what do I write ? I 'll just give a name , a place and age . All you have to do is read the rest . <newline> <newline> <newline> *James Roney* <newline> <newline> *1931* <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> This was the first time I 've written anything , so please be gentle in reading it . <newline> <newline> I spent 18 years in the Navy , all the way back to my youth . I ran and jumped on a ton of ships in my 25 year enlistment , but never went home . I spent some nights in a local house when my dad asked me to come home from the gymnasium when I was about to start classes in high school . I spent some nights getting drunk at parties , playing cards and drinking to much . I spent some nights getting sloppy with my friends , just because I was out of liquor . I got caught up in a love triangle and killed a guy to keep from the next one from happening . I watched him die from the wounds on my chest . I saw a cop get shot . I saw the cop go down cold and dead . I was in a car wreck driving drunk , not long after I got a call from the girlfriend saying she had found out about me . I spent all day drinking and drinking . I tried to quit alcohol at that exact moment . Then I got the call that I have n't told anyone about , saying my dad called it a hangover and he was driving home from seeing her . I knew why he drove home to see my mom . I was drinking a ton of alcohol to keep myself from him . When I got home and my mom was standing by the front door holding the door open for me , I just wanted to be out of the car and out of the country . After drinking all night and drinking a ton of alcohol , I took out my cell phone and called 911 . The officer told me to get the door unlocked . Then he told me that the police would need to come to my house and he would escort me . I grabbed my phone out of my purse , and called for the police . I told them it was because of the alcohol and that I wanted in for another call , but they told me all I had to do is stay calm . Later that night I went back to the house to call my parents and tell them about what happened and they told me that nobody will come home ever . When I arrived , I was in shock and tears . <|endoftext|>
[WP] You , a very busy businessman , and your employees find you have two options . <|startoftext|> I was in the same place as the day it happened . <newline> <newline> I saw the same exact thing , but I was a bit distracted from my usual routine from my previous duties as a secretary . I quickly got caught in my own rut because the world is a strange place , but I 'm going to spare you the fact that . I do n't know how I was ever to find out if it the end to all things , the beginning of all things that was to be expected , or to be expected . <newline> <newline> That 's why I must be the only one to remember this moment in time . It was one of my last moments in this strange world . I stared down at my watch as it went from midnight , to one in the first . The clock said four, but I could n't tell what time it was due to the fact that the world was n't exactly made for those types of times . It 's too dark to see clearly , but if I could see , I could see . I could see everything . <newline> <newline> I was on the second or third day , and the day after that I did not know whether to be happy or not , to know it was gone , or whether I actually was going to go crazy and forget what it was like to be me . <newline> <newline> As you may know , my boss was very busy today . I 'd already lost my job and I
