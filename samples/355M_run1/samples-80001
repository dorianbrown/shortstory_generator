 purposely , and , '' he paused . `` She really wanted to get married . '' <newline> <newline> I could see my father 's eyes widen . This was a major disappointment for parents . These parents were already in their early 90s . <newline> <newline> `` So what do you do for her ? What do you do ? '' <newline> <newline> `` She 's going to be rich ! '' He replied , obviously annoyed , as if he had thought that I would n't understand a word he was saying . <newline> <newline> I could see my mother 's face , which must have been both my father 's , because his face was just beginning to turn a shade darker . <newline> <newline> `` Then how ... '' <newline> <newline> `` Just buy a car , '' I said without turning from the road , and he grinned . <newline> <newline> But his eyes were still dark , and I was a little too confused ... <newline> <newline> <newline> `` But that does n't make sense , '' he said , `` How can she just ... '' <newline> <newline> I smiled . When he looked back at me , one of his dark eyes was fixed on my chest . <newline> <newline> `` She ca n't , '' I said , `` She would n't . '' <newline> <newline> `` And yet , '' he spoke , clearly still angry . `` Why not ? '' <newline> <newline> I chuckled . `` It 's my gift that you give me . The power to give . '' <newline> <newline> He smiled at me , then turned to watch the car drive along , and I took a moment to consider that . I might be married , or at least I hope that I am . <newline> <newline> I got into my car and got ready to take me back to the park . <newline> <newline> I made the turn . `` I really , really do n't see the problem , '' I said , to no one in particular . <newline> <newline> `` I do , '' he said , `` But I do n't want to see it . '' <newline> <newline> He looked down at my car . `` It 's my beautiful car . If I were to give it to you right now , I would lose what I have so long as you do n't have the heart to say no . '' <newline> <newline> `` Yeah , '' I started . <newline> <newline> `` But I ca n't , you have to let me try , '' I said , `` I would n't want to let that happen . '' <newline> <newline> `` And if you do n't , '' The Father smiled . `` She 'll get married with somebody worth knowing and then she 'll kill herself . '' <newline> <newline> What a perfect start to our first date . <newline> <newline> <|endoftext|>
[WP] The year is 1044 . A well-known historical figure has been assassinated . This is their obituary . <|startoftext|> A young priest from the local archdiocese was kidnapped in the middle of a field to be killed by bandits <newline> <newline> The local priest had been a staunch defender of the faith for years , and was known to have fought the evil of the knights who wanted nothing more than power . He had been known to hold his faith in what was called `` The Goodness '' , and fought through many insurmountable obstacles in the pursuit of the faith . He was the son of the local bishop who served on the church watch . He would have protected the church during the day with his family , but the day , it had to happen , everyone knew the news . The priest was taken captive by bandits of all variety , and was then forced to fight valiantly for the Church against the pirates . The knights had a high honor among them and they fought back and slaughtered the pirates in the field . The church was pillaged and the bishops were put to the sword for being too old to defend themselves . The Church has survived and was able to set itself up again as the bishop had said . <newline> <newline> The Church has reorganized as was ordered by the bishops and has rebuilt itself as a local government . Since so there are rumors of a new church forming to serve in the field , and is rumored that this will be the new Church of the Holy Ground . <newline> <newline> EDIT : I 'll finish this if anyone is interested . <|endoftext|>
