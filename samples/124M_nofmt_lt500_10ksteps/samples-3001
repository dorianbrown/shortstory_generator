've had it. They've done it before. And when it happens, they do it. But when it happens. <newline> <newline> The truth is, it's all just a bunch of people throwing their weight around and trying to get a feeling for who was causing it and how. <newline> <newline> Now what do you do? Do something about it? Go on, take me by the balls and I love you. But we can not do it. We haven't made it to the next step. <|endoftext|>
[WP] In The Black Forest <|startoftext|> “ You know why this is going on. You ’ ll have to live with yourself. ” The man stood with his feet crossed. His brow furrowed under the heavy black fur as he spoke to the other, and at the same time he gave a smile. “ Your sister and a friend of mine, I ’ m coming with them tonight! ” <newline> <newline> *" How can you possibly live with yourself? "* The man said with a smile as he made his way to the back door. <newline> <newline> He stood in front of the large oak doors and shut them, the doors were shut on him and he only got the best of it. "So we need to go home," he thought as he turned to see the man with a smile. He thought about the things he'd do to repay the time he'd spent in our village and the time he'd spent learning about the land to himself. <newline> <newline> He leaned against a rock. He knew he just had to help him. If they needed a person they wouldn ’ t be alone but as he looked around, he saw a whole pack of armed men standing on the edge of the stone wall that had been the closest to the entrance to his village. It was only a few feet from the entrance that he knew there was no danger of any kind and he didn ’ t have that much time to think about what he was about to do. The only people who were in the group who hadn ’ t already been slaughtered were the ones he had taken care of for the last few weeks. "Let ’ s go to the basement" the man said as he walked behind him. He looked down at his shoulder. He was wearing a plain black trench coat under both his trousers. He was wearing a white trench jacket and two white trousers. His coat covered his back, and a white t-shirt covered his entire face, the white shirt was the most noticeable of the color. His tie stuck out of one of the white socks he wore under the shirt. The other was the only one that had stayed the same as it had for most of the group, and it was wrapped loosely with a yellow string and tied into a bun. <newline> <newline> Just as he was beginning to reach the basement, he got a loud knock on the front door. He had the feeling he was in some kind of a hurry or something. He put his hand up to pull the door open before he heard a banging. "I don ’ t have time now." The man came across the door and knocked again. <newline> <newline> "Come in" he said as he pushed and picked up the door. As he stood there he heard the sound of a knocking. He went to the door and knocked. The door opened and a figure emerged. He sat down on the floor as he was surprised to see it was so small. <newline> <newline> The man who sat on the floor, wearing the same jacket he used to be sat on the desk across from the door. "Good afternoon, John" he said with a smile that reminded him of everyone he had seen so far, "and to hear the door open". <newline> <newline> He walked into the room he had to enter into. He turned on the door and looked into the door next to the door he had to go into. As he came out he looked around and saw a lot of soldiers and soldiers wearing different outfits. He looked around to see soldiers holding their equipment in front of them, and he looked at his weapon. A rifle laying in front of him. "Good morning soldier guys." He spoke before looking back to his weapon and he fired. When he took it for good measure he was happy about it. <newline> <newline> As he hit the floor he pulled out a shotgun from his belt and pulled a note from the other table. <newline> <newline> <newline> <|endoftext|>
