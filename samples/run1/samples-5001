 be a problem ? '' <newline> Her hair was still as brown as before , but her cheeks were a mottled mess . <newline> `` Look ... '' She said , with a sigh , `` It 's not that I ca n't fix it . I promise . '' <newline> `` I do n't remember when I was told I had to leave the city . '' I said . She still was n't looking at me anymore , and I just could n't see her . <newline> `` Well , I swear '' I said , `` It is n't the problem . It 's just that I 'm stuck here with this person . '' <newline> `` Yeah , alright . It is not as bad as you 're suggesting ... '' She still had her cheeks full of makeup , but she was n't looking at me anymore . Just in that moment , I was ready to make my move . <newline> `` Well there you are , I 'm sure . '' <newline> `` I know . The truth is , the ones you 're talking about ? '' She looked at me ... `` You know , I know a few people in there with us , '' I started as quickly as I could , `` Are you telling me this woman is n't *your* ? '' <newline> `` You 're not her , '' I said , and her lips were still closed . Her eyes looked as though they 'd been broken open . Her mouth opened as she spoke . It was then I realized what my mistake had been . In that moment , the fear was palpable , but not for long . I sat down , and looked at my phone to check it 's status . <newline> `` It appears that one of the men have arrived at the hospital , '' I said , `` I think he 's been asleep for a while . '' <newline> `` And why did you wake me up ? '' She asked , `` I just happened to wake him the other night , and he is n't here . '' <newline> `` Please , listen , please . I do n't tell my mother , and she 's probably not going to want to believe me . '' I tried to calm her down , but she was n't listening . <newline> `` Please , '' I pleaded , `` Please . Please . Please just call 911 ! '' But I could n't . She had n't even opened her mouth , and I was only being a bit more calm . She 'd been crying so much . `` Please . '' I begged , but I could n't move . I did n't know when to move , but she looked up at me and said , `` I told your mother I 'd call her again . '' <newline> I took a deep breath , and I turned to my assistant , `` I 'm the hospital assistant now , '' and she sat down by my side . <newline> `` I 've seen the medical reports , '' she said , `` They say that you 're not the right age to care about a person . '' I took a deep breath , but she was still looking at me . All she could do was turn red in pain . <newline> I went to speak , and she said , `` I 'm going to call the cops . '' <|endoftext|>
[ PI ] In the Rain <|startoftext|> I wrote this because I was sitting in the bathroom , having a cup of coffee and looking out the window at the sun breaking over the horizon . I never meant to say `` the rain is coming '' but I did n't have the time to try . I 've always liked to walk , so many people seem to be watching me , but nothing to show its presence to them . The rain does n't seem to be touching me , and if I 'm going to stand up to rain , I 'm going to walk all the way to the house . I like having a house that I can see , from the porch on the right , and I think people seem to notice this much more . <newline> <newline> I decided to write a new one . I 'll include the beginning of a section as I want to take my time , so I 'm going to give the first draft as it goes . I feel like I 'm pretty much starting to write something in a second or two before I finally finish . I just wanted to make it shorter than normal . This is the first chapter I need to finish , and the third I 'll have to finish . If there 's a way I can start over without needing to go to the kitchen and write a story again , I do n't think that 's worth the effort . <|endoftext|>
