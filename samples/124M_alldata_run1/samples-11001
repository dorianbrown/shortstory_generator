 so hard that it would ruin what had just happened . She was n't sure if she should leave me behind , maybe just take it for a walk . *I can do that . * <newline> <newline> `` I 'm leaving you on your own . '' I said . She looked shocked . <newline> <newline> I could feel every twitch of my finger , every touch , that could make me realize a feeling I had never known . A small spark of pain escaped her as the knife pierced , but it was not enough . <newline> <newline> `` Leave me , '' she whispered , a voice I did not have , in a pitch , low and guttural . <newline> <newline> *No . * I thought . I had to come back . <newline> <newline> I walked over to the corpse of the woman next to me , and examined her before I was about to leave . If she was the one that deserved this . I did n't expect her to see all the things she has for me . <newline> <newline> She did as I told . <newline> <newline> I was n't going to leave you . <newline> <newline> -- - <newline> <newline> <|endoftext|>
[WP] It seems that everyone has a superpower . You can bend time and space and change anything . But only you . <|startoftext|> I have a superpower , because I am a super-villain who ca n't break any laws , and in fact ca n't break any laws either , so I have no powers to break anything , other than my existence is my own . I have no powers , except to change things , but I am different , so now I will change time , and space , and everything in its way and nothing to nothing but a small small difference . Now , when I do n't try to change something , like the time at the end of every time loop , I 'm sure my powers are on my side . My power is , that of changing things : that is , of making them turn a little differently . <newline> <newline> Because , in this life I created , I was going to save people from my curse . I knew the truth about my powers , and I was getting the truth out . However , I was not the one who caused this , and that I did not care about the public , but rather , I wanted to know what had happened to everyone I saved from an event of my choosing . I had to be , to the point now my power seemed to be far beyond anything I had thought possible to . <newline> <newline> I created a time machine : the time loop which did this . But , it seemed , it was n't even possible , just like a normal time machine . I ran outside and found a time machine I created . I made this machine look like the time loop which created this machine - but I realized that the Timeloop was the only thing I could do . <newline> <newline> Since my power was different from everything , I did n't know what to do with the power . There were many things I could do ; that it made me much happier and I 'd be more satisfied with what I created , but then I would be nothing to everyone but myself . I did n't know what to do with my power , but I could change how people would interact with what I created . <newline> <newline> I made a bomb to make the bombs explode , but , after that explosion the bomb still destroyed me . I had made them to try to prevent people from falling out of windows , so I decided that all bombs should fall somewhere , without blowing their brains out . That was what I wanted to do . And then I created them : people who would make sure that they survived my attacks . They created a space bomb to create space around me , but then they made it on the same line . I was about two minutes away . I ca n't stop now , and I can not save everyone who is not an enemy of my kind . I need them . <newline> <newline> I will do whatever I want to change people from being dead to being alive . <newline> <newline> My greatest ability , which I used to be able to make myself better , is a power beyond anything I had hoped to achieve . I created a time machine with the power of making other people do things to the point that they will be dead , until they die from the same way I did . And my power is to bend space , time , and space around me , and change anything that will be created . My power is to be a god - with a reason . <|endoftext|>
