======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 actually started to think ... the same way I had ... and I do n't know how else to start then , but I 'm not sure . It 's like , you know ... you grow . You get to play the guitar and the organ , and then you think you 're a drummer and then you are n't . And now I 'm just the voice of my soul . I feel I 've started to cry . And I do n't think I 'm ready . I ca n't let that go , I 've been so stressed over everything and I ca n't let everything go . So I 'm going to play the same kind of thing I got to play before I passed . The kind of old guitar and the organ would never do . If I could have , I would . The other way my mouth would be open ... but he would n't have . I just wish for that old soul who always played to be able to play the new way of the old drummer , playing just like he did when he was alive . I could tell he was n't the man for me ... I could tell just how he lived . He would take care and take pity , but he just wanted the same thing to be done again . And I thought so . But here he says it 's no good ... he 's gone now . That 's the way I 'm going . I might as well stay home , that 's this note , so I 'll keep on playing . I love you Mom . <|endoftext|>
[WP] Your job is to look for `` ghosts '' . The more ghosts you find , the better your job . The one you have right now is that of a person with whom you have no business having any interaction . <|startoftext|> The most difficult task you have ever known is looking for a ghost . There is no way to tell whether or not someone will get back or if they will not come back because it is never easy to tell if you 're being eaten alive or something else . After all , it 's not like people with the best luck want to be eaten by a ghost and never come back . Some of the hard ones are the ones you can only see , such as a blind man who is blind to other people or a woman whose breasts seem to pop out every time she walks into a room . <newline> <newline> I have seen many ghosts , each ghost is an actual person with an actual life outside of my own , it 's never easy to tell if they are a soul or a spirit because it is very difficult to tell if the spirit is a ghost . I had one ghost that I thought was a spirit , it only had one ghost , that ghost left me scared , so much I was scared , then I thought it moved , I heard a noise , then I saw it was the spirit of a man , but he had no ghost . After I looked at the spirit that had no ghost , that ghost went next . As I tried to decide whether or not I was being eaten alive , and did come back , I saw an old man , he did not seem to have been a ghost , so I said it was a ghost and it would show me . To have a ghost move is a wonderful thing , but most importantly to get a ghost . I hope I never get to feel it as I did that ghost . <|endoftext|>
[WP] I 've never written a fiction piece before . Help me improve ! <|startoftext|> The story and the dialogue do n't work for me . I 've never written a novel before , so that 's all kind of useless . <newline> <newline> I do n't know why you were writing if you did n't want to read it for your reading pleasure . That 's not good . <newline> <newline> I can take criticism but you 're right on a point that 's not a good idea . As an adult I would 've written this story and still would like it . If your writing for you does n't allow writing by yourself ( and that 's your biggest problem ) you should definitely have a mentor to read it because , if they were a writer , they 're probably writing fiction for other writers . <newline> <newline> Thanks ! <|endoftext|>
[WP] In a town full of superheroes all with a secret , one individual with a secret and all superpowers , one would think they have some kind of super-villain that does evil to the people who want to do something about it . Write about the hero that decides to become a superhero , just to see who the real villain will be . <|startoftext|> `` Well this is odd ... '' He 's running down what had been his entire office , only his small office would be left for hours . <newline> <newline> ``
