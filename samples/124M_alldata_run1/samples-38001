======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 I remember . <newline> <newline> There 's something I want to say ; it makes me feel ... *familiar . * <newline> <newline> I 'm trying to remember this scene , but I ca n't . I try so hard . It takes years for me to come up with a convincing reason why I really do n't want this to happen , but I ca n't . <newline> <newline> `` Honey , I need to talk with you about this . You really need to put on the weight of this . '' <newline> <newline> I can tell it is n't going to work . But I know that I ca n't let him . I ca n't let my husband go so I ca n't die . I ca n't allow her . <newline> <newline> `` You 're telling me that now ? '' She 's trying to hold this together . <newline> <newline> `` You know what ? '' <newline> <newline> `` I want to know ... how it works ... how it goes . '' <newline> <newline> Her voice fades . I close my eyes . I can see it . I 'm staring intently at something ... my face . <newline> <newline> She 's still asleep , asleep with dreams in her head ... and I can see it from my perspective . <newline> <newline> ... that night ... the dream was so vivid . It was so real . It was like a nightmare ... I knew that I could n't keep fighting , but I knew it was a dream ... I ca n't do it any more . <newline> <newline> She does n't notice me moving closer , as if I 'm trying to sleep under my own power . <newline> <newline> `` Daddy ... I want you to stay with us forever ... until you 're strong . '' <newline> <newline> My voice fades out.. but I 'm still there . I can see the tears forming in her eyes as I move closer to her . I hug her again ... and again , and again . <newline> <newline> I want to go to her , but I ca n't . <newline> <newline> `` I 'll be with you forever , mommy . '' <newline> <newline> She breathes out , and I kiss her cheek , and I kiss myself . Everything is still . <newline> <newline> I ca n't keep my eyes down from her , but I can see the light fading from her eyes ... I 'm so close now . <newline> <newline> And now I 'm sobbing . I know that I need to keep holding her . <newline> <newline> `` I 'll be with you forever ... until you 're strong ... '' <newline> <newline> As I fall to my knees , I see my face on the small table that was once for her , but never for me . And I know that I wo n't be with her anymore . <newline> <newline> I have n't slept in ages . <newline> <newline> I know that today is a day of mourning . <newline> <newline> So I walk out of my bedroom , towards the door ... and look at the floor in front of me . <newline> <newline> And I know that I 've forgotten the love of my life . <newline> <newline> And I 'm sad . <newline> <newline> And I 'm happy . <newline> <newline> And I 'm sorry . <newline> <newline> and I 'm sorry . <newline> <newline> And I 'm sorry . <newline> <newline> and I 'm sorry . <newline> <newline> so many times . <newline> <|endoftext|>
[WP] You are a ghost . But not as bad as some people may think . <|startoftext|> `` Well , it 's hard to deny your own failings . In particular , the last ten years of our life have been an abomination to the minds of most . '' <newline> <newline> `` How will my own soul take me ? '' <newline> <newline> `` My life is as unending as your own . You will be one hundred percent happy , no matter what you 've been through . In fact , at the point of this line , you may feel that you might even be better off in the future . But it is your time . In exchange , there may be a chance of you being happy one day , or at least one day you will experience
