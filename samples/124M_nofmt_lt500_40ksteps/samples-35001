 really, and the worst thing is that I feel like I *know* she's going to take us. <newline> *** <newline> <newline> You ever been in that bar, or any pub... do you drink? <newline> <newline> Not once. <newline> <newline> You drink just like the others? <newline> <newline> Yeah, but drink is a big part of us, I don't think I'd be sober and I probably wouldn't be any worse off than you. <newline> <newline> You're an introvert in the way that you feel like. <newline> <newline> And I think that you're a very good person too, that there's some good people at this place. How can that be true? <newline> <newline> Well, you could have just said, and people really wouldn't look at that, that we're just a place to stay, but I think it really just is a place for the brave. <newline> <newline> Well then, I guess I've got a good friend here, who I really don't know. <newline> <newline> He doesn't want to be here though, he wants to stay here in the real world, you just don't understand the real world. <newline> <newline> Well, we got a secret, which we're going on about later, the other ones don't want any of that.

They're going to get hurt, I'm going to end up somewhere worse than I know. <newline> <newline> But, it's okay, don't get me started on the other guys, they're going to hurt you right now, you'll just have to survive them, after all you've got your own problems. <newline> <newline> Well, that was the end of the line though. <|endoftext|>
[WP] A man finds a time machine and wishes it could be destroyed . The only thing it destroys is his sanity . <|startoftext|> The machine shook in his hands and a single bulb fell from it. <newline> <newline> "What's in it?" The man asks, his voice a little unsure. <newline> <newline> "I need help," The man replied. <newline> <newline> The bulb exploded in a massive fireball, exploding to cover the man's face. But it was not there to cause the pain. <newline> <newline> "Why? Why does it have to be me?" The man was confused. <newline> <newline> "You need to stop being so stupid. You're just like all the kids in this school. You're too stupid to care. You are just this." The man looked at the machine, and with a trembling hand, the bulb had been put out. <newline> <newline> The man was shaken up. He was the sole survivor. <newline> <newline> His parents called him the last one. His brother. His sister. And he was taken away in a nuclear explosion, along with everything else in his life. <newline> <newline> The bulb exploded into a thousand tiny balls of smoke, all of which were still on his finger tips. <newline> <newline> The Man was crying, but he didn't have any friends around him.

[WP] `` All this power has made me the monster mankind needs '' <|startoftext|> ( This is my first attempt in a writing prompt ; Please be gentle ) <newline> <newline> "You're only 14, don't freak out. It's been 16 years, it isn't over." <newline> <newline> <newline> The man had been at the bank for a long time - maybe even a year - but his mind was still reeling, memories still tumbling through his head. He was no longer a monster, he knew, but more than that, he wondered... *could I ever be human again? * <newline> <newline> The question had been asked of him on occasion, for the past ten years.
