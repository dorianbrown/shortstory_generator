umped on the spot . He looked around at the small room , hoping to get a peek . He saw her body fall over her bedside table , the broken bits of metal she brought back into life . <newline> <newline> `` Are you okay ?

He had no idea what she was looking for , but he was in awe at how beautiful it was to see her body just fall into life . He did n't bother to look up , then walked back to his ship . <newline> <newline> `` You remember the war ... do n't you ? '' The old sailor asked . <newline> <newline> `` Yes , and yes , I did it again . The same old story . The same old story . This time , our heroes did n't hide .

[WP] Humans on Mars are now the only species left on earth . They have taken over the world and the only thing anyone wants is me . Humans on Mars are now the only species left on earth . Now , nobody believes me . Everyone thinks I 'm insane . I 'm not , but at least nobody will believe whatever ails me to this day <|startoftext|> I stood there , staring across the ocean ; my ship 's radio silence had kept my ears busy . I could hear her voice over the din of the radio , the faint noise of my ship to its left . I was in this place , the only planet on this planet , the only planet I thought to be worthy of my existence . I looked up at the stars , seeing only a desolate world in the middle of the solar system . I could see the sun itself rising slowly below it 's proper center . I just stared , unable to control my urge to stare back . <newline> <newline> A bright red glow . The air could barely see through the clouds . I let out a muffled cry . The world was frozen . I looked back at the Earth one last time . <newline> <newline> My vision was nothing but chaos and darkness . I looked at the Earth , all the more lost . I could see nothing but the last of my ship . I watched as the last shred of my ship 's skeleton came forth , and we were the only one left on earth . I could feel the wind blow against me as I looked away . I was so filled with rage that I did n't notice a thing . After a while , my rage had started to show . I could feel a great sadness rise up from among the rest of Earth , and I became depressed .

John ran his arm around her , and she felt him grasp her back , pulling at the fabric of her clothes . <newline> <newline> She began to feel the coldness of the coldness of the world pull into her , the coldness of the coldness of John . Her hands began to shake , and she started crying . <newline> <newline> She knew she was the one who would die here , she knew she would die by her , she knew she would die by John . She ran her hands down the thin sheet of cloth over her shoulders . She whispered to her ear , `` My mother 's name is John . '' <newline> <newline> `` That 's who ? Who are you ? '' <|endoftext|>
[WP] After many years of planning in which your friends and family never make it , you 've come to the conclusion that the only chance of surviving that is to murder someone and give the person your life . <|startoftext|> The words I am afraid to utter were the ones that came up once I got out of the house . They have become ingrained so deeply in my thoughts . `` You never knew anything would happen . '' My father was so pissed so I took out a gun with a single pointed screw . <newline> <newline> `` Then you 'd think I was the villain , the one who did n't have a chance in hell .
