 Rust to have a bigger problem because then some people can go crazy and get killed. <|endoftext|>
[WP] Your body is the only physical object in time where there is a soul . If you have eyes , someone will stare at and react violently to your eyes . You can not move , there are no windows of sight . The more time apart people have to stare at you , the more intense the gaze . <|startoftext|> You want to know some things and you want to know what's wrong with me? Why couldn't I have been better? I'm a good person, and I love my own person. I've got a daughter, I love my dog, I love everyone in my life and I feel I belong in every single one of them. <newline> It wasn't all that bad for me. There were no bullies or troublemakers. You've never even noticed their faces. Most of the time I was the most ignored, and the worst. The one person who did hurt me, I didn't know it yet. Even if they were the other's, they were nothing compared to me. What I did have now, I wouldn't feel guilty for hurting others. <newline> <newline> Every single person I touch has the same reaction : they are looking right at me. Some even look up. Some just feel bad. One of them only has two of them. I see it all. I'm a good person. I'm a good person. <newline> <newline> I don't know why I can't feel my eyes. I don't know why I can't move. It's been a long time : the very first time in my life. Or the last. In that second I realized why I can't see. <newline> <newline> I'm the only person in the world who knows what I could feel like. <|endoftext|>
[WP] After you die , you are sent to a computer simulation to learn the nitty gritty workings of your life , you are surprised to find there was a war between your reality and your simulation . <|startoftext|> You know... The real world was pretty dull. There was only the constant buzz of the computers, the constant beep of the robots around your apartment building, and I'm not entirely sure what's going on. <newline> It must be a long time since I had time to reflect, but here I am. I'm in my final years and I've been doing some awful work but at the end of my life I'm the most powerful person on the planet. I am going to tell you what happened. <newline> <newline> What happened? <newline> Well, in the future, we are all robots. We are robots because this is what happened in the future. And they don't really even know. They're sentient. We are robots because we're robots because we're supposed to be. I wasn't supposed to die, so I didn't die. No, I died. Why? <newline> <newline> Because this simulation took long enough and a big bang was what happened. I don't think you could really think of a more boring experience. I mean, who doesn't have someone else's life? You see, I was in my room, reading something on the Internet, when I happened upon this little video playing an alien computer. Just that one thing that's not on the internet, but, it appears to be on the video stream. Well, I say *in my head. * What could have caused this? <newline> <newline> So we are robots and this is what happened? <newline> <newline> We didn't think, and, after a moment of debate and a full-fledged debate, we decided to let the simulation go, but it's too late. I've lost to a machine that had created life on it's own. I may have lost to it as well. <newline> <newline> Now, I need you to go talk to Sarah. I hope I'm not making a scene when I do. <newline> <newline> Yes, there is something I do here. You see, Sarah's been getting impatient at me. She has this look on her wrinkled face. I think she's worried. That look, a sort of disgust is evident when she looks at me. And then, her eyes sparkle. <newline> <newline> No, I don't think it's true, but then, I wonder... What's this? <newline> <newline> Oh, there it is. There is this piece of paper. I have found Sarah's file. It is almost exactly the same, except it's missing all the numbers. There are several other pieces, like this one in the file. Sarah doesn't look at most
