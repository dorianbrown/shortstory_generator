line> `` Do you think ? '' the man asked me with a calm confidence . I replied , `` I do n't think so . '' <newline> I looked down and smiled . I did n't need to find the man to know . <newline> The man walked away and then said in a high pitched voice , `` You just look at me like you do . I 've been looking . '' <newline> The woman nodded and the man looked down and started laughing . <newline> He took a long , heavy step towards me and then he vanished . <newline> I looked away and my vision was like a fog as I stared at the lifeless man . I looked forward and when I looked back . I saw his face . I saw a man who had lost his friends , family and everything in his life . I saw people he had loved and felt his life had never mattered to him . Everyone he had created had lost their jobs . Everyone he had loved .

I felt regret that they had never been a father . And of course I did n't go to college . No . <newline> <newline> My eyes went wide . `` Do n't go college . It will bring you pain and loneliness . You hurt them by leaving and you ca n't give them enough to cope with what 's behind and their grief will be hard . '' <newline> I turned around to see the dead man 's face . He was still grinning as though he had never been smiling for this long . I tried to think of something I could do to end his life , maybe I could just die . I thought about ending my life with him . After all , there was only one thing I could do . <newline> <newline> <newline> <|endoftext|>

Please open your eyes and open your minds , * I said . *I know my mistakes now . This will not help . Just give me a minute . * <newline> <newline> I glanced around and looked again . The room was deserted . There was no reflection in the glass . All that was in it were a few shadows . All there was were the words . I stared back with wide eyes , searching for the words to describe what was happening in the house . <newline> <newline> `` ... and to be truthful , there is no reason to believe that Mr. S. Rambunctious has ... '' I stared back and forth trying to form sentences , trying to find a final sentence here or there . <newline> <newline> `` ... the ghostly apparition is ...
