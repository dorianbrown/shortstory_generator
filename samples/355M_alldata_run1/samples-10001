======== SAMPLE 1 ========
d just a bunch of other nerds playing Halo , at least you know how to shoot someone with a crossbow when they 're in the same space as you . <|startoftext|> I was standing at the front line , at home in my basement . I thought my time of need to be over a few months but I was n't gon na let that fool me . When I reached my little town of Newerth , I did n't expect to find any support , no help , no help at all ... I expected the war to be over . I expected the people up in Chicago to be dead and abandoned by the time the war was settled . I expected to take the guns away and turn the country in a blaze of flame . I just was n't gon na let those men take the guns . <|endoftext|>
[WP] Everytime someone is born someone else gets their soulmate 's soulmate 's soulmate . Someone is born every time someone has a child . <|startoftext|> The moment he was born it was something that seemed impossible . I felt a wave of fear sweep over me like a wave of a chill wind . That I 'd never get my brother 's spirit because of that little baby thing . I knew that it would happen and I tried to stop myself from doing it but no matter how hard I tried , my heart just kept beating in a way that only something cold and calculating could do . It did n't matter how I tried , after every single day I would have another thought of what my brother 's soulmate to get . Some guy , my son , the name would be his soulmate . I told myself I 'd get it to myself and keep it bottled up , but all my attempts ended up just adding another layer of protection to an otherwise unbreakable barrier that I had n't overcome before now . <newline> <newline> At first it was something that was n't really mine . It did n't matter where I 'd been or what neighborhood I lived in or what friends my twin could n't out and forth , there was no answer . I ca n't even remember a time I felt safe to talk to my son . It was the same everywhere he came from . Even when he went to a different city , the house I could afford . How would I know he knew what he was doing ? I do n't , but he did . He did . He had the money . His mother did . He had money and children . I do n't feel any different as an adult . <newline> <newline> I was a bad guy on the streets ; I had been . Now I am a bad boy . <|endoftext|>
[WP] The first two years of your son 's life were spent under the blanket before the second year after he was born . <|startoftext|> I opened the door to the hospital with a grin on my face . <newline> <newline> `` Aww yeah , '' he grumbled , `` I got ta tell 'em it 's been good . '' The little girl , tiny and delicate , smiled at me , and I walked back through the doors and back to the ward . A couple of steps , more that ten yards , I made it through the corridor . They were two months , and it was over . Not really . That was the problem . <newline> <newline> `` The boys are ready to move on , '' I say . `` He 'll start the new school and learn and grow and learn and learn . '' *What the fuck was she trying to say ? * <newline> <newline> `` Do n't worry . They all have to start their new lives at some point . If you get a little too late , Mom will be coming , '' I say . <newline> <newline> She was twenty-six , five pounds under-five . I smiled . <newline> <newline> `` I know . But this is the start of everything . '' The nurse 's eyes glowed gold . <newline> <newline> I nodded . I looked up from the monitor at where my son sat . He was n't a good looking little girl , with an awkward chin and a crooked nose and an air of desperation behind it , I knew that . The room he was in held its own secrets . I had to get him to school healthy , to make an effort . I 'll start a new relationship with him , a new foundation for young healthy children ... <newline> <newline> I smiled . `` Well , there you are , '' I smiled . I 'll be there by two years . I could n't let him suffer like this , and no one could blame me for my happiness . `` I love you . '' I kissed him . `` I love you too . '' We got up and ran on the walk
