 to your heart ’ s content ” . <newline> <newline> Now you are all you ’ re left to hope and that in the end your soul gets crushed by all the weight of this place , you get a sense of closure but you do not , yet it ’ s too late for that . <newline> <newline> “ The man with the mustache , ” the voice says . “ A man who took the most men ’ s lives , so many men ’ s lives . It ’ s impossible. ” <newline> <newline> You ca- “ I was here. ” Silence . Then you hear it : “ He was with her at his wedding. ” <newline> <newline> The voice is now your one , and in your heart you 're now a man , you know it . The voice has given you your voice and you are a man now , a man and woman , a man and woman . <newline> <newline> Now you have heard what you can not say .

And you have heard what you have never heard . You can not tell them you love them anymore , that your voice is theirs .

[WP] You wake up in the middle of the night just in time to see yourself appear in a strange room . <|startoftext|> I woke up . It ’ s early morning – you wan na get up ? I ’ d think that ’ s what you wanted to stay up at least ! <newline> So I opened my eyes to not be so dark . The sky was white – not really a big deal– but I found my reflection . It was n't really as weird as I thought since I noticed things that were n't my own . The light on the ceiling and walls were definitely white – not the black you ’ ve been talking about earlier – I mean white . I had dark hair and makeup but I had bright green eyes . <newline> Not only that but there was this weird mirror on the ceiling in a bright room like mine . Not only that but when I went to look around I recognized all these other people everywhere around the room . But this time I did n't look exactly like anyone but just vaguely similar .

I turned back around . “ It 's been a beautiful day . Now get the f*** away from that mirror okay ? I 'm just going to call Mom and Dad with a lot of questions about that whole thing and I 'll talk to you when I get them. ” I walked away . <newline> <newline> -- - <newline> <newline> If you
