[WP] It 's World War III , the world is under siege , and you are forced to intervene . <|startoftext|> It was really a simple and very short game . I would never have a hand in a death match . I would never stand a chance against hordes of zombies for fear of being killed or being revived . I would make a few extra saves before I killed the enemy commander , I would take his life , and I had no clue how I would die . I figured , `` Hey , I 'm not really playing that game , not yet anyway , but I was just gon na have to die and do nothing and then there 's the zombies again '' . <newline> <newline> Then one of the troops came , to get up in arms , and said , `` Sorry what 's wrong , we did n't know what you wanted when the enemy army came from below '' . <newline> <newline> `` Oh , yeah , I got a small hole in my back '' I grinned . That was the whole point at that moment . <newline> <newline> I felt the tears begin to fall like my hand would never touch mine . I grabbed my rifle and said `` I 'm sorry this happened '' . <|endoftext|>
[WP] Describe why you always sleep alone , or what that has to do with all the loneliness . <|startoftext|> I used to run my hand through my hair when I was still young . I always tried to find my way when I was at my peak . Like I 'd been for the good times at school . The days had to come to mind though , no one ever seemed to forget me now . <newline> <newline> When I was fourteen , I was sent back to my childhood home town , where I had always been . I was sent into a world of solitude , which was always at my fingertips . Now those feelings had vanished . I looked for more of something , something that would take me back to a place I left behind . But there was one thing that I found ... <newline> <newline> My body felt cold . I looked around , knowing that it was cold . There was no way I would survive anymore . When I thought about where it was , there was nothing . I looked for the perfect place for myself . An end to my suffering was at my hands . <newline> <newline> I used to run my hand through my hair when I was still young . I always tried to find my way when I was still young . <newline> <newline> Like I 'd been for the good times at school . <|endoftext|>
[WP] The world is in a state of chaos , in which the human race is in perpetual war to kill itself . Humanity has discovered a way to fix itself by killing itself and living forever . It is a test . <|startoftext|> I woke up from slumber , with a strange feeling that I have awoken in my sleep . I can see many humans , but I am also blind ; a rarer condition than vision . The world around me is now dark and filled with a thick layer of nothingness . It must have been a good dream to have seen humans since the first humans emerged on this planet , and thus could have never imagined such a place once existed . My eyes have no vision , as I feel myself being trapped within a hollow hollow of nothingness . The world is no longer the same as it was then , with each person I see is different . The people I witness , I am no longer a singular person . The world I see now is all I had when I was a child , from one generation to the next . <|endoftext|>
[WP] Write a narrative from which the narrator is unaware that the narrative is about his own life . <|startoftext|> *All day in the morning* <newline> <newline> I do n't remember it . <newline> <newline> I think back on what I would do to have time in my daydream , to be alive and well . <newline> <newline> But no , no , *I have n't* . <newline> <newline> So I have been forced to live my life in the same universe that I have been living . <newline> <newline> I wake up in a single place in the same city - a town , but one that is different ; the same kind of town . <newline> <newline> I see cars rolling past - the same thing once , but one of a thousand times . <newline> <newline> Of course , I have to be on time to catch my bus , because I always wanted
