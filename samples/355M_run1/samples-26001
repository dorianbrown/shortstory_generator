 agent for us . He 's going to make things right with his 'project ' . '' <newline> <newline> I tried to speak , trying desperately not to cry out for help as the words came out of my mouth . <newline> <newline> `` I ca n't believe in two of us , you and me . You came out to me and said you could n't work together no matter how much I did . I did n't expect you to let me out of there , but what do I know ? '' <newline> <newline> `` You gave me the money . I did n't need it , and to be honest I did n't expect to get it . You are going to give me what I need . Please do n't give up . '' <newline> <newline> I choked up . Tears , I had n't been crying since we last spoke to each other seven years ago . <newline> <newline> `` You are an asset . You are going to put me in jail , for a year for this and a year after for that . I am a criminal , I am nothing more than a piece of trash , nothing more than a piece of paper and nothing more than another shell which will disappear . I will be forgotten . I am so sorry , and I am so happy to have you by my side . '' <newline> <newline> She closed her eyes and leaned against the edge of the bed . Tears were welling at the edges of her cheek . She held all the strength in her voice and pushed her shoulders back and out of the bed . <newline> <newline> `` Do you want me to go ? '' I asked , hoping my words would carry through the tears that were welling up . <newline> <newline> She looked at me with hope and nodded . <newline> <newline> She took out a bottle of pills and drank them and felt like she was just at peace . <newline> <newline> -- -- - <newline> <newline> *I have no idea who the hell it is . * <newline> <newline> I looked up at the ceiling . The last thing I thought is that my face was going to change forever forever . <newline> <newline> <|endoftext|>
[WP] `` It 's not all bad , is it ? '' <|startoftext|> They call us all the wolves in their name ... The wolves who roam the fields of wheat in winter and eat the little things we leave behind in our carts . They say the wolves are bad , and that the humans are bad , and all we can do is wonder if it actually happened . <newline> <newline> But the wolves do n't tell us how bad it is . We go by the same name because nobody understands us when we 're screaming . I say `` it 's not all bad , is it ? '' <newline> <newline> I used to love the sheep . I still do , though . It 's just the animals I get to play with on their journeys that make me want to curl up by the fireplace and watch them starve or die . They wo n't have meat in a week , and maybe I 'll live till then , because I 'm still a good kid . <newline> <newline> So we are . <newline> <newline> <newline> I am still a kid .
