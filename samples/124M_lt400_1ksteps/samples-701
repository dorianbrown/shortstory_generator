 look to be used by men . <newline> <newline> I see the shadows of the road , the shadows all around me . I 've seen my parents before , I know them well , a lot of people look at me with the eyes . It 's something to remember them . <|endoftext|>
[WP] You are one of the lucky ones that get out of debt when you actually do get to . <|startoftext|> It was only after I graduated from the university in which I worked my first job as a paid-off debt management representative that we finally figured out that I 'd finally be able to take advantage of the new life I was born and live in as a free woman . As I had no job left with the job I decided that I would be in an interesting job at all of the high school sports . Of course I could have paid off the debt , but in order to keep being free to do whatever I wanted with no debts I had to be a free woman . So what can I do ? I can go see a doctor and make a few visits but even that is not the best thing ! In order to stay in and be in the right place and getting treated like a free woman I had to prove I was in good health ! <newline> <newline> I was working at a McDonalds fast food restaurant when my boss was n't in the passenger seat ... I heard them talk to the wait staff . I heard the sound of a gun on the table and the smell of the soda . I thought about the car , its name might rhyme right but it had to be a cop car . I did n't see the sign of the police , the officer was gone ... I did n't think I would ever get out of it . <newline> <newline> I drove back down for a short bike ride , I parked my bike off the street and then I rode the bike on the road , a few times , past the bar and back to my house . I stopped for a quick coffee . An idea for me to get this idea to pass would have been to go to a bar , I could do a great job at a restaurant , but it would have taken a lot of hard work . <newline> <newline> I got a great feeling in my brain when I stepped into Starbucks . It was my friend who asked what I was doing . He said it was the best thing to do . As I turned around and opened my door to walk down the street , my mind was filled with the feeling of seeing a young female in the street , staring back . Before I could react that feeling took over my life and I realized why ... . . It was so easy to walk down the street , and I looked right into him 's eyes . <newline> It was a good feeling , and when I walked in the street I immediately knew ... it was the happiest I could have been in a long time . Now that the moment was gone I was free . <|endoftext|>
[WP] The story begins with a single letter but in the end , it continues after . <|startoftext|> I 'll get it . <newline> <newline> -- - <newline> <newline> I always did . I did my best , I never let myself go far off . I was the only one who did that , but I did n't tell anybody . It was n't until they found out I did n't have the money for them ( or if I did , they were still looking up my name ) that I realized . <newline> <newline> My father , who was a big man of a kid when I was a kid , was a man of a friend of mine and told me , in his own words , that there was no money in his account . He said this guy was a great guy and was a friend of mine . They asked me what was wrong with me and I told them to tell that to my parents . When I was 16 and my school started , I told them that I was going to go to college again . My parents never told me that . <newline> <newline> So I do . I never did . I never should have gotten a job at a place where I know the people I have loved . That 's one thing I will never do again . <newline> When you 're doing all this . <newline> <newline> ---- <newline> * '' I 'm going to do it . '' **The end <|endoftext|>
[WP] The year is 2500 A.D . and the human race is about to invade the world . The world has never been peaceful in centuries . <|startoftext|> The world is a world of fear , chaos and fear . This year is a time for our destruction , our invasion of the world of
