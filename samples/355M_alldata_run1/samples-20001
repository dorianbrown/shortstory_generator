 . <newline> <newline> <newline> The man said in the robotic voice of a robot , *You see ? * <newline> <newline> <newline> The man 's hand went to the glass , to his mouth . His eyes scanned the room for the answer , he had been going for too long and all he wanted was an eternity of peace and quiet , but it still had to come next . <newline> <newline> The robot looked at him for the last time . <newline> <newline> `` Goodbye , my friend . '' <|endoftext|>
[WP] You 're an NPC in an MMO , you got so good at it , that a random event in an event , you just saved their life . Unfortunately , it 's the third time they 've died , and all they want is to get out . <|startoftext|> He had been able to have it so long that he was now nearly as sure of his own survival . It was the kind of game where every one had a chance to be taken by surprise by something . The same people that had to kill himself were now the ones that made him kill himself . Not one person had a chance at life except one . <newline> <newline> `` Come on , man , you 've been alive enough for too long of it . '' hissed a woman he recognized , with a kind face . `` You 're only getting to do this now , you know . '' <newline> <newline> `` I know you 've been doing it so long that you know that . '' <newline> <newline> `` We 'll call him '' <newline> <newline> He walked over to the lone chair , the seat of some type of metal . The rest of the occupants stood idle , watching the monitor . <newline> <newline> `` Is he okay , boss ? '' hissed a woman the only one who was interested in his work . `` Is he okay . '' His voice echoed off the metal and glass as he sat there as the chair he was set too sit . A few of the people in there were nodding in agreement , almost as if they were doing nothing at all to take care of the boss . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> After a few moments though , the woman in her chair slowly spoke up again `` His name 's Max '' <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> The man smiled knowing what to expect . `` Hello , I 'd like you to take your rest , please have time to relax before you take in what 's happening . '' <newline> <newline> <newline> `` What ? '' <newline> <newline> <newline> `` You are free to leave now , but you will still be in the game , and you can choose to save a man 's life after all . '' In her quiet voice , she said with a smile , `` But it can not be a man 's life that would mean that you were still alive and able to do this , right ? '' <newline> <newline> <newline> `` Well I 've been able to save them , yes . '' <newline> <newline> <newline> `` Now I know that you do n't remember , I know all of this might just be a game , but you must do what you must . You have the option of leaving today . '' <newline> <newline> <newline> `` Oh , I did n't get the chance . '' <newline> <newline> <newline> `` Please , after you have saved the life of one of the people in your line of work , why does it matter how many humans died in the process , why does it matter that you are still alive ? '' <newline> <newline> <newline> `` Because at the moment of our demise , we have to accept whatever we are forced to do . '' <|endoftext|>
[WP] You die of something that you ca n't do ; death by suicide . <|startoftext|> I opened my eyes and looked up at my vision . When I awoke , as with all others , I did not see pain . I saw bright light . Light . Bright light . <newline> <newline> I could see a man lying in my bed , unconscious ; he was in his late thirties , probably in the mid fifties . He looked about the same age as me . <newline> <newline> I felt strange about him . I mean , you look around the room , but somehow I still felt the presence of the man ... *the man* . <newline> <
