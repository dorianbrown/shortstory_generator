======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 you are a good boy/girl and you are playing with the wrong toy . <|startoftext|> I was walking home . My dog looked up at me and waved me over . I wanted to say something but I was too tired . I went to the top of the stairs and stood in a tree and let the sun be my focus . <newline> <newline> The girl , of all people , started to cry . I looked over . `` It 's for you ! '' I said to her . `` I love you so much ! '' <newline> `` I 'm sorry , but this is my favorite toy . I ca n't keep her . '' <newline> `` I 'm sorry , but this is the perfect size for me . She wo n't fit in the toy . '' <newline> I wanted to tell her but it is rude when you are sick . She starts shaking and asking for help . I can see her tears running down her cheeks . I know where it is going . <newline> <newline> I know there is a problem . I could never keep her . So I tell her this situation will pass soon . I let her know I 'm leaving . I can see no one stopping her from leaving . I want to save her . <newline> <newline> She is moving and she is gone . She left me alone , and that is not a good ending for me . I sit alone in my apartment and wait . <|endoftext|>
