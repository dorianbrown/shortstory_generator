 his voice . <newline> <newline> “ Oh and your favourite . I ’ m going to leave you with this for now but your favourite is still very special. ” He said as he took a long drag on the cigarette . <newline> <newline> “ So , you ’ ve been around for a long time. ” <newline> <newline> “ I have been , I work the night shift here and you ’ ve been on the job for like a year. ” <newline> <newline> “ Do you know the most important part of the show ? I mean , I only have a million viewers and every one of them wants another scene with a man that 's been in a lot of action and action movies. ” <newline> <newline> He stared at the screen for a few second , trying to remember his favourite . The old one about the man getting stuck in mud . The one about the time the boy gets really drunk and the car breaks down in the rain . The one that was really dark and really scary . The one with the kid that died in the car , and my favorite movie . <newline> <newline> “ I have no idea what you ’ re talking about . We ’ re probably going to get more and more action and I would love to watch you in the dark. ” <newline> <newline> “ Do you ? ” I ’ m in a lot of action and I ’ ll probably have a bunch of action in the dark. ” <newline> <newline> “ Oh yeah . The one with the guy that went super insane before driving over the boy ’ s car with a broken window . The one with the kid that died in the car with another car . The one where the dad was a zombie . ” He was a zombie for a long time . “ We used to have a lot of movies like these . We used to have the big bads , like Batman the Killer ! ” <newline> <newline> “ Yeah. ” <newline> <newline> “ That was really great . Now , your favorite ? ” <newline> <newline> He sighed again and smiled back at the screen . “ The one with the kid . He was like so scared and I just helped him to his feet. ” <newline> <newline> “ Oh. ” <newline> <newline> “ Yes. ” <newline> <newline> “ The one where the boy went into hiding from the cops and the bad guy , and the bad guy got really angry at him . And he got really mad at us because we were doing bad things and he needed us to be punished. ” He rolled his eyes , taking a long drag . <newline> <newline> “ I remember that one . The one where he goes into the bathroom and we just watched the kid go pee in the toilet to clean up . Then he goes into the shower and we get hit by an earthquake and he ’ s pretty angry and does n't know there is another earthquake. ” He reached over and grabbed my shirt . “ You know what ? This is just me . And not really any of the other actors . It ’ s a bunch of me playing the parts and a different kind of my personality is just the voice. ” <newline> <newline> I leaned forward to grab him . “ Well , you ’ ll see . Now , I do know I have more action than your favorite movie , so I ’ m not really any good at any of it. ” <newline> <newline> He leaned toward me . His eyes and expression changed to look at me . He was looking deep and I could tell that he was almost as surprised as me when he looked up and said . <newline> <newline> “ How far away ? ” <newline> <newline> “ I ’ m going to ask you , but I have to be honest . I want them to really know that we ’ re just a bunch of actors and you ’ re the lead actress here . And my action is only the parts that lead to the real action . It ’ s really nothing else I can do. ” <newline> <newline> He laughed . “ A real fucking idiot. ” He laughed for a moment and then he took a drag and blew smoke rings out the end of his cigarette . He turned to leave but then he looked at me in surprise . <newline> <newline> “ I have no idea what you ’ ve been doing ! I only want to see you in action ! ” <newline> <new
