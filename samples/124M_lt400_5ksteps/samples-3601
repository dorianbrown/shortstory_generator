======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 the time when I was an infant - when we had our first meeting , we just talked about all of the things going on right now ( the holidays , work , vacations , we got to attend school ) . I remember thinking how crazy this life was going to be . All of our friends were there , and everyone was there , so I never knew what it had to do with the whole thing though.. When I walked over to the front door when the door opened with a loud thud , I heard her voice and was very surprised . She was a pretty pretty girl , a few days ago I 've felt a lot . Well , atleast it was a bit weird . I did n't hear her sound much then , though , as she was my guardian of the family I 'll never know . I walked out , and looked back at the door . <newline> <newline> She was walking into the door as I made my way , when I saw her she was a little surprised . `` Hi , my name is Emily Knees .

[WP] Write a story that uses the same four letter word as `` Good Things '' . <|startoftext|> The good things were the good things . <newline> <newline> Things like the clean air and drinking water , the food they 'd throw at us , the beautiful music , the lovely wine , the beautiful flowers , the beautiful girls with cute faces who made you smile when you drank their water , the little gifts you offered and the wonderful toys they 'd throw at us . <newline> <newline> The good things were the small green things that were all I could ever need to enjoy the good things of the good things they made me do them . The big black ones that were always on the table . The tiny ones with the words `` do not forget '' engraved on a little bit of their chest . The little ones that showed up when your parents were away with you , and when they passed . The little ones that taught you everything that there could be . <newline> <newline> And the good things were the people who told us how to be good to each other . People who told us to care and the things they did to help others . <newline> <newline> The good things were the people who helped by creating things . People who were good to each and everyone . And the good things were the people who gave it their all . That is why , yes , I want to use the next sentence : 'I need help ' . <newline> <newline> <newline> ( I have this thing in my head that makes me smile when I think of the good things , but it 's all I can use in the good things . ) <|endoftext|>
[WP] You go to get a ticket to the museum 's birthday party but realize that it 's been completely abandoned for the thousandth time . That 's when you realize your mistake . <|startoftext|> The man sitting by the counter was getting very bored , so he walked out . `` How about we go out and meet someone ? Or maybe get to the top ? '' He said after an over-the-top presentation . <newline> <newline> He was very nervous , trying to keep his head up on the project and he was very surprised that he could actually manage the project to the top of the park , the top of the zoo . He then remembered he could only do one thing there : he was going to have to go see a museum that only he could access . <newline> <newline> `` I just do n't understand , how am I allowed to go see a museum with a complete lack of knowledge , even if it was by accident ? '' He asked himself , `` Why the hell were n't I a doctor ? '' <newline> <newline> It just seemed more and more ridiculous . But even now he did n't understand why all the things he was supposed to learn were gone . <|endoftext|>
[WP] You go to an international meeting of all governments about how far people are from the laws , and how the world will react . <|startoftext|> `` We 're about to speak to a group of representatives from each of the worlds governments before heading out to the polls . '' the President asked . <newline> <newline> `` Oh . I know , I know , it just seems like a great idea at the time . But , how can we keep up with the world ? '' I questioned the President . <newline> <newline> `` Well , we 'll have to figure that out soon , '' the President said . `` The people are just getting tired of seeing us get in the political races , and we 've got to try to keep the politicians away from the issues they care about , while the
