A few years ago we had no ability to develop humans . Since then we have grown in numbers , and we have grown in speed , and we are the kind of animals that could not evolve , only evolve . Humans have to evolve . <newline> <newline> And if we evolve , we grow , and we develop as other animals , we will be a species that does not evolve and evolve , and evolve as we need . <|endoftext|>
