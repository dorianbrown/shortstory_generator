[WP] When you were six , your parents got their powers from a school event a few years before . This power was the power to speak another language . Now you have the power to speak your own language . It 's your first day at school . You are your own human . This has only gotten darker . <|startoftext|> My first day at school was like any other . The classes were good enough to pass without any trouble , and the teachers were a pleasant bunch . A few of them had an extra 'I ' they 'd try and try again ' attitude the next week , but it had n't happened . I 'd watched for hours as the teachers went through their first day reports . I did n't notice all of them were taking such terrible stances , but I was getting worried for them . One of them was going to go off on their own rant about how their school had been a waste of time , and how it was their fault . <newline> That was after school ended for me . I made a quick dash through the school , only to be met by my new teacher and her co-teacher . They 'd taken a rather long time to arrive at each other 's desks , but I managed to get up by now . No matter how mad you go , these two things seemed a little more... interesting . <newline> I rushed to my room , and the room was empty save for one book sitting there . I looked in it , but there were no notes . I walked out of the classroom a few minutes later , and into the hallway . <newline> I went straight for the door , slamming on it and opening it myself . I walked back inside , and found a girl I knew . The whole class was staring at me on my first day . The class had been good . The new girl had the power to speak another language , and she was taking it , not me . <newline> `` Why did I become human ? '' she asked me . `` I could speak my language ! '' <newline> No ! <newline> I turned to the girl in front of me , and she began to tear up . `` I do n't care anymore , '' she sobbed , almost choking . `` I will never forgive you . '' <newline> I turned with an anger , and saw what it was . A woman . It had been a long journey of struggle from here to there , but that 's where we are now . There 's many things we 're not meant to do - to learn , for example - and what we see is a man who has been abused by his society and who is trying to find his way out . <newline> It was my sister , she had n't accepted it for a long time ; she was worried about my education . She even went so far as to ask me if she could go into the classroom herself . But then it was too late , and she was gone . <newline> I could have been in this class more time , I did n't know what to do . I tried everything I could think of , but nothing could bring me back . I did n't think it was right , but I was determined . I wanted to speak my first language . I was scared of what would happen to me if I did , but no matter what , I was determined to try , no matter what . <newline> It took me years to work myself out of feeling scared of what would happen . Eventually I had a confidence , I started studying , writing and studying again , and finally I felt that I had something I could accomplish despite anything happening in my life . I started working hard at school , I kept working at school and I was accepted to college . But then I realized I had the power - I was human . But still , there was a time where I had a problem dealing with the world outside of my walls , and some people did n't understand their power . I tried to be understanding , but it did n't help . I took a deep dive into the dark , I discovered my true language , and it terrified me that people would see my speech as some kind of aberration , the result of something out of my control . The dark inside me screamed . I was powerless , I was never meant to exist outside of a normal day , but I just stood up and said to a few school leaders , `` I have something I 'll do . '' <newline> They all nodded once or twice , and they tried to figure out what to do , but the thing was that I was a hero and had to choose whether it was safe or not . But they did n't know how to act , so they chose to be silent . That 's when I knew that we were different people and I would be
