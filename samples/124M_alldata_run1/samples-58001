newline> The police came at 3 and 4 , the FBI at 5 . <newline> The only problem was the suspect 's body . They did n't have a warrant , but an x-ray showed it was taken out of a black van . The police said it had been taken on video . They said the killer was wanted for questioning . <newline> <newline> This is the only reason that I 'm writing you now . <newline> Yours is my own personal project now . When I first asked my wife to take care of it . I said it was really , truly a miracle . She agreed and it 's been five years , two months and two hours without any action , but I 'm not going back to that . The only thing I have left and everything I have in my life . The only thing I 'm in my head right now is these words . <newline> <newline> <newline> *They had us here in cold sweat . They had our men here in hot weather , wearing black suits and black gloves . They had us do everything they could , not even knowing we were there . * <newline> <newline> <newline> The doctor who brought you over was one of the scientists who would be giving this to you . He 's not even mad , he just does n't know . They 're still trying to figure out . They 're calling this something that we have to keep a secret . <newline> <newline> <newline> The world has n't changed but I was n't mad until a man came to me from down the road . He was n't my boss , I was n't even my family . He approached me with this package and I handed it to his friends . They all had a box filled with these letters that he had signed , signed with his name . They had so much to write that they had to memorize them . <newline> <newline> <newline> He 's the scientist . My family , my friends , my life , all we had to do was write . We had to scribble in his journal or else we were going to lose that little secret with him . When I was a kid I would write down the words that were written down by others that we did n't know the other was . I could n't write down his name because it would mean something . My father had been very close with father that he wrote for me , the only way I knew that we would ever meet . When I grew up in a large family and father working two jobs I learned that I was going to write down those words on the paper that I would never forget . I did it . <newline> <newline> <newline> He was a quiet man . He wrote down these words and he said them to others , said them in the box . I 'll never forget them . <newline> <newline> <newline> He had the best handwriting you have ever found on a sheet of paper or a book . He wrote these words on his journal and I 'm not sure why . I 'm not sure this is an old one to write on . I never took anything from my father , or my life . Not him , not him . Not even a letter or a name , but he wrote . He did n't mean words , he wrote things . He wrote this , and I never want to forget . My name is Robert Johnson , now . <newline> <newline> <newline> It was only a year after that , you 're still writing . Maybe a year or two before my name is written down . I do n't care though . The letter that I wrote was on the paper . He wrote he wrote 'you ' <newline> <newline> <newline> He will never forget the letters he wrote . <|endoftext|>

Listen to it . * <newline> <newline> “ I know you ’ re a machine. ” It was only a moment , that last few moments , of silence and bliss before I felt a sudden , deep longing . It was a moment of wonder and loneliness , a moment that left me alone . <newline> <newline> *Do you want me to be a machine to you ? Do you want me to be a machine to you ? * The words slipped quietly from my tongue like the water in the pitcher . I knew what the song meant for once , but I could n't tell if he was still listening . <newline> <newline> As I looked at the device that held him captive , I couldn ’ t help but think back on all the things I was so proud of .
