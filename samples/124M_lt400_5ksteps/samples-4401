A war so important to him that every one knew he would win , the final war , and his will be unstoppable . His victory was finally about to take him . <newline> <newline> As he started to feel the dread as his world ended he decided to take action . `` I 'm done for '' he whispered for he felt the fear the same way he felt the final war , but was now ready to do anything he had to do , to give up his life for the ultimate victory .

[WP] The hero 's most trusted friend asks an entirely unrelated question ; `` Who ? '' <|startoftext|> `` Who ? '' <newline> <newline> Everyone has a friend . I 'm not much of a friend , but I 've been this close to him . I know this because today , I was at work . Everyone had a friend . I used to meet the guys who were really good at the bar . Nobody has friends . <newline> <newline> I just keep meeting her and she 's always giving me advice , especially one I call it a life of hard work , hard work . She wants my help , says they could help her , helps me , help everyone else . I say , `` You 're just a friend , do n't ask me where I 'm going '' . I ask her for a ride home , she leaves me and tells me I have to stay home . I feel like an old man walking through his deathbed . She tells me she 's here to help . <newline> <newline> We are still at a standstill , but it is her job to help me , to help others . Her job is to keep me sane but I keep going . I remember the night at the shelter where she was with that mom and my little sister . She kept me sane but her job is to keep me safe , to keep me going . He was kind and caring , he was the friend I had used to have and he still continues to help me . He 's my friend now , he 's my friend at heart . <newline> <newline> He will come . He will help me . He will listen . He will listen to my pleas as my life is to be saved . He will come and help me to a happy future . No one has a life of hard work , no one has a world to live in . <newline> <newline> And I 'll be safe from what I am . <|endoftext|>

The cancer is spread by one person , over a couple years . <newline> <newline> With one lucky day , all of these people are gone forever . <newline> <newline> My family has given me a new life . For as long as I can remember , they have been there . Every time . I can remember when my brother tried to put me in my room . I know the man who tried to make me disappear . <newline> <newline> It 's not the way I thought it would be . It 's not how they feel or how this medicine worked .
