 a bright and shining light on a person 's forehead . <newline> And that 's when I 'm telling you , the truth is , there is nothing else . Nothing . <|endoftext|>
[WP] The first time we saw your ship . We have been waiting for years , waiting to see what you do . <|startoftext|> He looked back as I looked back at his . The air was thick with sweat on the inside of his shirt , but I could make out some of his dark , angular features ; darkening as they seemed to age . The men behind us were still in our uniforms , though they looked almost as if they were wearing the same thing all the time now , a tattered coat made from some material that had yet to be fully formed , but a thick vest-like vest covering their muscular physique . <newline> <newline> He stepped forward slowly and put his hand on my shoulder . `` I am in no shape or form that you would want . '' <newline> <newline> I nodded . `` You ca n't be here for this . '' I looked off into the distance for the first time , taking a few deep breaths , the cold sweat pouring across my sweaty skin . `` But what if this is the last time ... '' <newline> <newline> `` I think not . '' He shook his head and looked back . `` I do not want to see this again . '' His voice was heavy , almost frightening . <newline> <newline> I nodded , and stepped back as he approached . It was n't difficult to do so . We had been so close for so long ; we knew it all too well . If he said his final words , they would be the same as mine when I got up . Even after I stepped out the elevator doors and walked down the narrow walkway towards the landing dock , there were still so many other bodies just waiting to catch up to him . <newline> <newline> We had to wait and hope . <newline> <newline> -- -- - <newline> <newline> *This is the first time I 've seen you . * <newline> <newline> I leaned into his face . She was still holding my hand . *I know everything about you , * she reminded me , *you come to me when I need you ... and I can use that information to manipulate you . * <newline> <newline> I looked back on her last words . *I think I 'm in your mind , * she said sadly . *That 's how it must be , you have to be . * That is why I am you . * <newline> <newline> He smiled , a cruel , cruel smile , a crooked one , as though he felt this need more than anything . *We may not know what you are , * I told him , *but at least I know you . * <newline> <newline> I glanced back at the other passengers , knowing that they could n't know . *I will be in love with them ... * <newline> <newline> It was time . <|endoftext|>
[WP] A giant box of chocolates is held together by some unknown , yet reliable , means , and the contents are hidden away within it forever . The box , however , has one last box in it . <|startoftext|> `` That was amazing ! '' The kids said , eagerly awaiting a chance to take selfies with the super awesome chocolate chocolate box . The parents said to the children , `` Well , you guys know he got so much more fun stuff to do with the life he built , right ? '' <newline> <newline> The parents were ecstatic . `` So he built that giant box to have fun with life , right ? You guys are just here because Mom and Dad said so . '' The kid on the 4 was not happy about this and went to help his father . `` So my dad built one of these giant boxes , did n't he ? '' He said to the kid . <newline> <newline> `` You know he did . '' The kid responded . <newline> <newline> The parents stood on top of the box , waiting for the last kid to go through with it . There was nothing inside except some boxes . The parents would tell their children that it was a secret . It has some kind of power in its box , which they ca n't tell what to look on , but they do know it is there . For that reason , the parents can not find anything inside it . <newline> <newline> Finally , the kid was done . `` I 'm sorry '' the mom and dad said to a boy who had done nothing wrong . `` So now the children and I are here ... '' they said to each other . <newline>
