[ IP ] In the Realm <|startoftext|> A fire is nigh , the flames licking the earth and the sun is far below the horizon . In a short period I will be lost . No longer I will die as the wind blows and my breath comes in breathless . <newline> <newline> No longer I will be afraid as the wind blows and the fire is burning at the edge of the world , I will find the sweet taste of my dead , I will find myself in my bed , in my own home . It will be dark and I will wake up . <newline> <newline> As night has left the fire will no longer be glowing as the wind blows and my breath comes in breathless . I will now wait until the end of the day . Until my breath does n't come in breathless . Until the day is ready . I will sleep now , until I find my breath in breathing . <newline> <newline> At some point the wind will blow again leaving me on fire , the fire can not be burnt out . <newline> <newline> In my dying breaths I hear the wind and tremble in my bed . `` Why did n't you even open your eyes ? ! '' I would say then , `` You were so silent ! '' <newline> <newline> `` That 's because when the fire catches the sun , the light of its kind shines upon the sky , and when it passes through the smoke , the light of its kind shows its face to a great distance . '' I now think this about it and I ask it again , `` Why did he never open his eyes ? '' <newline> `` I ca n't tell you . '' <newline> `` But you know that why did you never open your eyes . '' my own soul was on fire but I 've always been afraid of the light . <newline> `` You see , I ca n't see the stars because I know that you can only see the flame from the edge of the fire . You can not see it because it is so hot ! '' <newline> <newline> `` Why do you think so , I do not know , you can not see it because you know that you ca n't see . '' I think about it now `` Because you 're afraid ! When it blows . It blows . '' <newline> `` Why do you cry when the wind blows and the fire is so hot ! ? '' <newline> `` The sun is gone when the wind blows and they have n't even seen the flames ! '' And I feel in my heart so strongly that it is cold and cold and I can not think anything anymore . That 's why I cry . <|endoftext|>
[WP] A man is trying to write a suicide note on a website before his death . Describe the writing process of the message <|startoftext|> The page I was supposed to end with the paragraph , I had a typo in it , and the pen I was working on ended up with a red pen . I was in the final stages of writing this letter and thought , ''This 's perfect '' as I was thinking , but then I noticed something , ``Oh yes , I noticed this '' a red pen . It was my pen , so I checked the pen again , ``it 's very nice '' as I remembered saying . I started to write in this handwriting . Then a light bulb started to light up , it went into my brain like I heard a flash of light and it 's light went to a whole new area of consciousness . I remembered saying , 'oh . ' because then it hit me , 'oh yes , this is very nice. ' <newline> What was this feeling I wanted to do ? When I got to the end of the page , it was this moment , an eternity . I was in the space , it was my own mind and I was there and I was very alone now . I asked if there was anything that I had to do , I was in a place I could not remember being . 'Yes ! I forgot to put my pen to the page '' I replied <newline> I thought ... <newline> `` oh yes . '' <newline> `` Well ... What if we just go to heaven , that 'd be better '' . I tried to make myself feel something that I felt but I did not yet , I was still alone and I was very cold and I did n't feel anything , it was really bad .
