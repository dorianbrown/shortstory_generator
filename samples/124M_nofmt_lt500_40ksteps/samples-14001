He was sad. <newline> <newline> "So you remember her?" <newline> <newline> He took the child from her at her side. Her hair now grey and curly. His beautiful wife was gone, her life was a farce. <newline> <newline> *So it's all for the son, * he thought, *and for the father? * <newline> <newline> He put the child on the table with the note, and it was done with a smile as he stood there, hand on the table and face down. <newline> <newline> "There will always be a time and a place for you, but not too soon." <newline> <newline> He picked the child up, and brought her back. <newline> <newline> *All by my side, then. * <newline> <|endoftext|>
