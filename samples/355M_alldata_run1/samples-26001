 distract my . `` No one in particular would do that , '' I replied . <newline> <newline> * '' Ah , but ... '' * * <newline> <newline> `` It 's your time , son ! See you there , '' she said . `` We are all busy . We are all busy . Remember , you may be alone . That 's why I have a big tent with all these people in it . '' <newline> <newline> * '' And who are you guys ? '' * <newline> <newline> I blinked in confusion . I realized that he could n't possibly be from outside our own world . But then he could certainly be from the human realm . I did a quick run around the tree , trying to find him , and I quickly ran away , almost stumbling back into the forest . <newline> <|endoftext|>
[WP] We finally discover that the Moon 's moon , which has been observing Earth through the past hundred years , actually works as a small asteroid belt surrounding Earth . The asteroid belt is now completely barren and Earth now lies in the shadow of the Moon . <|startoftext|> It was a sad day for a few human years ago . The last moon had passed the edge of its orbit . It was a sad fact , but I digress . We are at the mercy of this object that is nothing like the rest of the sky , because we can not reach it due to space time . My son , the last , was about 10 or so and a long time ago , he was in his high school days . He went from being a student , to being the first year of college , to being a professor , to getting his PhD . My daughter had her graduation today . At a young age I had to do many things . But my wife was very good with paperwork and my dog was very well trained . We were just not in agreement about something , but that was not our problem . That was a different one . <newline> <newline> A decade or so later we reached what the object did . The ring would n't be able to touch down , but Earth could . It was the final barrier . My son was in a class , that was how much of a barrier it was . His peers were sitting in the seats . I could hear his teacher , my boss . They were discussing something . I did n't want to know , but my brain was telling me . <newline> <newline> `` Did the object stop moving ? '' `` No '' `` No '' `` When was the last time they moved ? '' `` In a short while '' <newline> <newline> My son looked around , trying his best to be polite . `` How have you done this ? '' he squeaked out . `` Oh good , thanks for the offer , the object is here . '' I started to be more nervous . <newline> <newline> My mother sighed . `` Maybe this was another ploy , '' she told him . `` We would have to deal with him first . '' <newline> <newline> A short while later I heard my son ’ s teacher announce the decision . <newline> <newline> “ Earth is the only way out ” <newline> <newline> My father was still listening . My father had just gotten the news from the news network to be on the network shortly , after the news broke . <newline> <newline> “ We ’ re moving ! ” cried my father . “ We ’ re gonna be going right into the sky ! ” <newline> <newline> The object came to earth and soon enough there was a flash . I looked up , saw a large hole in the sky , and felt a large wave hit me . I cried for my son . He ’ d gotten lucky . My hand was shaking when I saw my family ’ s children , with the object in the sky , just like myself . I cried while looking at the debris . I looked in the eyes of my son . He was crying . <newline> <newline> “ We ’ ll see tomorrow ” he blurted . The ship took off . <|endoftext|>
[WP] An army has been put out of their combat phase . They just were not there while the rest of the army was put there . <|startoftext|> “ The last of the soldiers , the last of the ones who can now understand this country of ours , are now being pulled into a single building. ” Colonel Algory spoke the words , “ It ’ s too late , ” the crowd was beginning to lose focus , all that was done was for soldiers now . “ I said the last of the soldiers , I didn ’ t mean the last of the ones who can now understand it.
