If I wanted to live this life , I would have stayed in bed . My life would n't be this way . '' <newline> <newline> `` What do you mean ? ! How was I supposed to live this life ? ! '' <newline> <newline> `` Oh , my . So you 've told me this was your plan ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Well , that makes sense .

They decide to give the new technology a try and experience the environment there , only ... ... . <|startoftext|> The crew of the ISS watched in awe as we entered the red rock known as Mars .
