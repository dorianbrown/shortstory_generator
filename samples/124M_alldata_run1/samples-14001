 was done . I had nothing to hide . <newline> <newline> The next day I had the news over the radio . I had been given a full name with a birth date , my parents were a real man . We were happy together at their first birth , we had no kids and I was a rich man . Life was easy . <newline> <newline> This morning , I woke up crying in the hospital . My girlfriend took my wallet . My car ? Not the one I could afford . She asked me if I wanted some more money I told to cash it . <newline> <newline> That night , I went to sleep . <newline> <newline> The next day , I woke up the same day . She asked me the date . The date was exact . I told her to give a date . So she did . As it turns out , it did n't go very far . <newline> <newline> I was never the type to fall for the wrong girl . I 'm not the type to be with the wrong girl . I 'm just tired and hungry and I just want to go home . I got ready to go , I pulled out a knife and prepared to kill myself . <newline> <newline> It appeared that the date was the easiest thing in the world . And I was not about to try to kill myself . <newline> <newline> I did the knife . <newline> <newline> Then I knew it . I saw the mark my parents had with my other daughter the day before . I could see that they had my sister . Maybe it was the stress , or maybe there was something wrong with my little girl . There was no way . <newline> <newline> I stabbed myself . <newline> <newline> It had the best feeling at the time . That I died in the first moments of her birth . That I will have no one knowing at their mother 's funeral . I did n't have to know for sure . The thing had a name . I got myself killed . <newline> <newline> The next day . <newline> <|endoftext|>
[WP] You are sitting in your parents room when you feel a pain in your hand . You look up to see your father but see nothing but a man , with the wrong beard . <|startoftext|> I remember the first few times my mother and I had gotten together . I saw my father sitting in my room at the dinner table with one of his friends . He looked like he was talking to one or more strangers on the phone with a very concerned look on both sides of his face . He said to his mom that I just had to come home with my father to tell him of my situation . Her eyes were wide with confusion as if she knew exactly what I was going to say . <newline> <newline> I was very curious about this man and my parents thought that I was about time that I could do something with him . We both agreed to it and we decided to stay as close friends of each other that we would be later . Unfortunately , our first few conversations were all confusing and it was n't even an explanation as we always found a way to talk . After our second discussion about the situation , I was still a little taken back , even though it had been years since I 'd been alone . <newline> <newline> That night had been a long day for either of us and it was only our first day of school . We decided to sit for the night before the bus arrived . I did n't like staying that long but we were having so much fun in school and it was the only way to make this happen . I looked up to see my father who was sitting behind me , with my hand raised over his head . He was clearly stressed and upset when I 'm standing between him and him and I looked up to see my best friend . He was a very good boy . I did n't think I would ever see him again and he felt he was being a selfish child . <newline> <newline> I looked at my friend and I did n't see him as he was standing behind me but was his hand raised up by it 's side . He did n't really like this . I felt his hand wrap around mine and he said he did n't like how I was being so upset . I stood and stared at my friend and my dad but my friend looked up at me and said he did n't like the way I was sitting beside him <newline> <newline> `` I do n't like it '' he said . he put his hand on top of ours and I looked away as if he was n't there . I thought he sounded disappointed because his eyes would turn blue now and I looked back at him and his face was the same . <newline> <new
