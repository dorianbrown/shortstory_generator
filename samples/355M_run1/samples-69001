 what of the world from him . I can only imagine the pain of it all . I never knew what he felt at the loss of me before today . He 's so very upset and I fear he had a bad experience with God and my loss in the womb of my mother aswell . He should n't get these feelings ... it was something he should never do . <newline> <newline> My father and I do n't hate God , we just pray for what we lost . So far there 's only pain , we only prayed for what we did n't get along with . I love my father and I have no regrets , he did n't bring me happiness that one could expect . We are so glad that we got to know God . It 's hard to say that God has a smile on his face and I believe that he did something that was best for us in our lives . My father tells me that my parents never told us the truth , my father said something that I am n't aware of . My mother told me that my father and I got along and that we will get back . My father told me that our lives went on in an almost perfect way to the point of no return . My parents are gone , he and I both felt betrayed and disappointed . My father tried all that he could but it all still went wrong . <newline> <newline> My mother did n't believe me , she had a difficult life and a tough choice of words . She told me that she had a child for Christ and that when she saw him they would be one in the same with mine . I heard this a few times and I always said we would be able to have kids together . The doctors said he would get better but eventually there would be a time that people say to take him , but it would have to be for our sake . My mother told me it would hurt and that we should have a child to be thankful for me . I had a dream of that for that one . I never told my father the same dream . <newline> <newline> My father was in a deep depression and was so nervous . This dream I have about our son and my mother was all that kept him grounded and in a way that made sure they did n't break his heart , and they never did anything wrong and he always felt safe in there . I remember the doctor telling us that he was going to become a priest and his child would be brought to him . That man I had been so happy to be with , always giving him love and kindness . I have never told him the truth , I do n't want to have to face him in the end . As a child it felt amazing that a man was capable of bringing his child to him ... but he wanted more of a better world and his child would be taken away . My sister asked if he felt anything or if he was just excited that my mother was n't around anymore , and that he felt good that he could be with another woman . `` I know but I want to believe that I could take him to a better world . '' I never heard an answer , they told us we would be happy in that life after all . <|endoftext|>
[WP] You 're immortal , but only after someone has tried to kill you decades before you are born . You 've been sitting on a throne , bored with the life you 've led . <|startoftext|> When I was a young man I dreamed of freedom and I hoped to be a free man . I dreamed of living , but all I could think about the future was the one I had long been waiting for . I loved a friend , a family , and a job . I dreamed of being rich with the knowledge that my name would go down in history as a mighty king . A million people would know that I should have left that part . As I grew into the time of my death I saw all the good people of our country and felt a part of each of them . I would be the one they fell . <newline> <newline> <newline> The story about the man is told in a book whose title is the same as that which I was the king of . The one who was a king , my brother whom I had loved for almost twenty years and a friend of mine with whom we had lived for thirty years . It 's the one who led those I was in my time and those I was n't until all of it had happened . I was dead when I lived in the throne , the great king that had been made by the king . The one whose name was King George of Canada , he had conquered the continent with his military might . All in all the war had gone on for him thirty years before our time . <newline> <newline> The stories of my brother and his bloodline were of great pride , and pride had meant that the blood of kings meant that some kind of money . It meant
