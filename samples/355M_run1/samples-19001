 . * <newline> <newline> *You did n't even see it coming , did you ? God bless* <newline> <newline> I did n't expect this to happen . I only wished there was some kind of way to keep my distance . I could n't help but feel the cold steel in my chest tighten , knowing the man I 've killed so many times already . <newline> <newline> *The only way to save yourself is to accept what you were given . What you 're suppose to do is to accept your own path . If you have a choice , I will go off of it , and instead I will look after myself . I 'm going to accept this . * <newline> <newline> `` But ... *God is n't perfect ! My actions may be bad* , but *it 's not the actions *I'm* responsible ! * The consequences are too great , there do n't have to be any consequences ! '' <newline> <newline> `` Well , that 's just it . *There 's only two ways to fight it , one is to be good to yourself , the other - you know , not doing what you have to do . If I do everything the way I have to do , I will be so happy in spite of myself* That means accepting death , that means accepting my own path , and taking care of myself . * *Maybe if you could just sit the fuck down and think about it , it 'd be okay . * '' <newline> <newline> The silence stretched for a couple of moments longer until the man sighed . `` I ... I would n't do that to you . You *wouldn't* do it . You do n't know me . No , I do n't know you . But , what you have to do is good for us as a company . I really hope there is some way to protect those guys from the consequences of their actions . '' He turned to look away from me completely . A tear ran down my cheek , and I saw all the anger in the man 's eyes . The last words I could manage to make out before he spoke : * '' I do n't have that option . I do n't really know you as well as I thought I do ... '' <|endoftext|>
[WP] A child was born without a nose or eyes . When they are old enough , they are told that they can grow up with any facial feature . But it is n't until adulthood do they grow them . <|startoftext|> I had lived with the parents of both children for the past 5 years . I 'm going to assume they are not rich , but if you ask me , it could be the same . <newline> <newline> <newline> This is where the problem started . While living with them , I grew accustomed to a large variety of facial features . I had grown up with them . <newline> <newline> <newline> But the problem was in adjusting my expectations . <newline> <newline> <newline> I would always look into the eyes of my parents and I remember thinking that they were like little little holes , just poking a hole , and I would feel some discomfort , but not from embarrassment . <newline> <newline> <newline> I grew to understand what was happening when I was about to be asked to do things , and the thing was , I could n't do it . <newline> <newline> <newline> The thought crossed my mind in the mirror . <newline> <newline> <newline> I did n't want to make a face , wanted to be completely comfortable . But I knew what I had to do . There was no way to stop it . <newline> <newline> <newline> Even though they were my parents , I grew closer to them and realized I could n't hide anything . <newline> <newline> <newline> But I had to do it . <newline> <newline> <newline> I looked into the mirror and I could see my parents . I could n't hide anything so I decided to face what I did wrong . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> But I was not happy with a face as I have now grown to despise it and felt my face was just getting worse with every second .
