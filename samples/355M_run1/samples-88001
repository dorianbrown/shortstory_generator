======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 in those early days of the Internet and television . We had to keep moving , to fit in . To be comfortable with our place . No longer . My favorite part of the internet was the ads , the `` Internet has never been this good . '' The first was a `` You get what you give '' spot . But I never really thought about it . I mean , come on ... we were young , and dumb and had all the time in the world . My mom always said never to make the same mistake again , but I could see it changing . It just made me feel ... better . <|endoftext|>
[WP] You are a superhero in your own mind , that is n't a hero though . You are also a super villain . <|startoftext|> It was a cold morning , the sun bright and shining through half an inch of blindingly hot asphalt . It was one thing to be on a street in the city , but this ... I was in New York . No , it ca n't be right ... and I 'm not a supervillain . No no no , I am not . <newline> <newline> I was in the park around the corner , when a young woman had stepped onto the grass . She was wearing a red cloak of some kind , with gold-framed spectacles and a crown on one head . `` Oh my God , '' she said to herself , `` I 'm going to die in this cold . '' <newline> <newline> It was me , wearing a white trench coat and a white cap and a tuxedo . The only thing I had on me was my scarred , broken finger that still had it 's signature scar . That was why they did n't pay me . It was what I wanted , what I needed . <newline> <newline> `` You want to hear my story ? '' I asked my voice smooth , natural , not his usual gruff , hoarse and angry . <newline> <newline> I knew where he was hiding the body of the other , and I knew what I had to do . `` I know , '' she replied , looking at the ground , watching the wet concrete beneath it . `` I 'll listen to whatever you were able to tell me . '' <newline> <newline> `` I am just a girl . '' I began , `` I was just a girl . '' I looked at her , and thought . `` I was a girl , the same girl as you . '' <newline> <newline> `` You have no right to tell me your story . '' She said , `` It was a long time ago . I remember it like yesterday . '' <newline> <newline> `` How old was I when you killed me ? '' <newline> <newline> `` 18 years , '' she said . `` My father was an old widower . He said he never found the right woman to win his beautiful , beautiful love . I knew I was meant to marry her that day . '' <newline> <newline> `` I was jealous you were going to marry a woman when all I wanted was to be with you . '' <newline> <newline> `` I am jealous , '' I said , `` because it was not the love of my life that did this . It was an old man , about 80 years old , who was trying to help a man he loved for the rest of his life reach his full potential . '' <newline> <newline> She stood , staring at me with her mouth open , her eyes widening . `` You did n't understand . I was going to marry you , because I was going to love you . '' <newline> <newline> At this point , that made me angry , but I just did n't know what to say , and I did n't want to . `` You did n't understand because I had broken your heart , and now I am going to break yours , and you ca n't fault me because I let this happen , '' I said . <newline> <newline> She looked up at me , her dark-blue eyes wide . `` You need to come back to me . You need to come back to your home . Your family . '' What did I know , she was going to kill me ! `` It is your fault . You 've gone and killed other people , '' I lied , `` and I know you will do well to stay away from the other people , '' I had n't lied in months ! <newline> <newline> `` I know nothing . Please , help me ! '' I pleaded . <newline> <newline> She stood up and walked back to the girl . `` I know you 've been separated for a long time . You wo n't be able to forgive yourself for murdering thousands . I know you 're heart is broken and will never heal
