> * '' You think you 're crazy ! '' * <newline> <newline> `` No , I mean , I suppose '' , said my friend . `` This is so fucking confusing . It feels like somebody was trying to write a new sentence , only to have something that looks like an old piece of paper . And then there were the comments : <newline> <newline> * `` I 'm going to miss the time I wasted writing that sentence '' * <newline> <newline> No one else had read that , and that 's when I realized that I was still mad . But it had something to do with my previous writing , and how I had used this writing in school . I had no idea how people were responding to `` I 'm going to miss the time I wasted writing my first piece '' . <newline> <newline> `` You know , how did you get the first piece of paper ? '' * <newline> <newline> `` And I 've been writing since you first came up with the first letter I came up with . '' <newline> <newline> * ... but if you take it to the point where there 's no other reason to *oh well , you 're right . `` * <newline> <newline> `` I guess I 've finally written the first piece '' <newline> <newline> And I was mad . It was the first piece that I wrote the first year of college , before I turned it into a book . My favorite author , Martin Shkreli , had taught me all this . When I was fourteen , I 'd read a book with a pen and paper , and it had a beautiful story . <newline> <newline> But then I realized , I had no idea how Martin Shkreli 'd had taught me all this . So I 'd go to the library , and I tried to read one last time . And I 'd find somebody who 'd actually written it . <newline> <newline> And then I had read it . <newline> <newline> And , well , that last time , I had spent all this time writing the third piece of your paper , and it was just as beautiful . <newline> <|endoftext|>
[WP] Death , the first death , was an ordinary human being and , more importantly , was n't evil . <|startoftext|> `` Death is n't evil . '' <newline> <newline> The voice trembled like someone had never known to me . <newline> <newline> `` It 's too slow . '' <newline> <newline> The words were all I could muster . I was too tired to look down at his face , to look away , but as the last line began to come down , the voice came . The first sound felt like water hitting a glass , and my heart dropped . <newline> <newline> I fell to my knees . <newline> <newline> `` No . No . Do n't . '' <newline> <newline> The voice stopped . The voice was more sinister , more sinister . <newline> <newline> There was still something stirring outside , I could tell . I felt myself slipping off . My vision would begin to wither . There would remain no light outside of where I sat . <newline> <newline> The voice stopped and my vision became a haze . The last sound seemed to have taken a slight , rhythmic break . I felt as if I was going to go back into the shadows , and wake up . I did n't . <newline> <newline> There was no light outside of where I sat . There was no sound . And yet the light was there . Above me . With my mind gone , nothing happened . <newline> <newline> I knew , as it seemed to go on for a million years , that what I would never be could happen to me . I was , of course , immortal and had been immortal for millions of years , all because my mother died in childbirth three days after taking me to an emergency room in her hospital bed after she died of heart disease five months ago . <|endoftext|>
[ OT ] How do you write a story about someone 's death ( that is not necessarily the death ) ? <|startoftext|> I was standing in a small room . I was sitting in a small circle , with my wife , her head to the right , on the left . I was staring at the face of my wife and my husband . The face that I had never seen and had always craved . I knew I had to kill for my wife . I must know why . But there would be no telling how to get through this to them . <newline> <newline> I
