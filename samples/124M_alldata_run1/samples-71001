 . '' <newline> <newline> I looked at my sister , `` Are n't they just going to say how I 'm crazy ? '' <newline> <newline> My sister shrugged , `` Oh yeah dear , I mean , I 'm not crazy as you think , but they 'll make fun of me for being like this . '' <newline> <newline> I looked back at the table , and saw nothing but white , blank chairs , and even worse the sounds of laughter permeating through the room . Then , the laughter started again . <newline> <newline> `` Oh , you know , I would never do this . They are so far away . I do n't even know if they exist , though , '' said my sister , `` But if you ca n't stop , I 'm going mad and do n't know where you 'll go and how to get it out of your system if you just let them in . '' <newline> <newline> This time my sister started laughing as well , and it was only a few short steps before my sister disappeared . <newline> <newline> I got up from the chair , and turned towards the door , `` Is my sister still there ? '' <newline> <newline> My sister stared at me , `` Just the chair , dear . '' <newline> <newline> The door opened . I looked over and found myself face to face with the most beautiful girl in the world . <newline> <newline> I turned around and she was gone , with nothing but laughter still to be found , but as I turned my head and turned my neck to look my face was still the same , with my sister as I held her . <|endoftext|>
[WP] A group of students find themselves in the middle of a conversation . Make me question reality . <|startoftext|> This is a story from my favourite character , Michael . <newline> <newline> `` Michael '' i said , as the two figures in the classroom looked at each other . At about the same time I heard a voice say `` Michael ? '' <newline> <newline> I looked back to see if it was n't my teacher . She was busy studying and taking in the view of the classroom . `` Yes ? '' <newline> <newline> `` What is he looking at ? '' <newline> <newline> She smiled and responded with `` Oh , uhh , I 've never seen him , he keeps looking at the computer screen . '' <newline> <newline> `` Who is he looking at then ? '' <newline> <newline> `` He 's a computer guy , I could n't tell you it ... '' She paused . `` I 'm sure he 's just looking at something '' . As she continued her gaze of his monitor , the sound of a video camera going haywire began to fall on the floor . The sound is a deafening cacophony which echoes through the room . <newline> <newline> `` Oh , that 's not good , is it ? He does n't take his time to put the video together . '' <newline> <newline> There was silence in the room . <newline> <newline> `` Why , I thought you liked it , why were you so busy with studying ? '' <newline> <newline> There was silence in the room again . <newline> <newline> `` I 'm sorry , I forgot his name , he said he 's from the middle of the woods . '' <newline> <newline> I saw a glimmer of recognition in his eyes , and a grin spreading across his face . As they approached each other , I began to think about my own family . I decided to walk over to the back of the class and ask my teacher what this was about . <newline> <newline> `` Would it kill you if I told you ? '' <newline> <newline> I looked at the monitor . A small video recorder was playing on the screen . The camera was tilted down very slightly , but the video quality was too weak to have been able to hold sound . As I moved towards the student 's desk , I noticed he looked different from others with such a high opinion . As he looked at the screen , the video camera was moving closer to the computer . <newline> <newline> `` You look ... different ? '' <newline> <newline> He nodded slowly , and said `` Yes '' . I looked toward the computer and noticed that I was looking at a large file . I looked at the computer and noticed an error . After fiddling around with the monitor , I tried to input data into a small audio file . Using that , I could hear and see more about the subject . I
