 I 'll be damned , '' I told him . `` Just look at these people ! They had to die ! '' <newline> <newline> He turned to me , `` You 're not just a few pictures . It 's the rest ! '' he laughed . `` They 've been alive the whole time . '' <newline> <newline> `` What about the children ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Well , '' I told him , `` the children were n't just children , were they ? Some kind of group of teenagers ? Or were they just kids who lived ? What were they doing at night ? '' <newline> <newline> He looked up at me , `` They were just kids who had grown bored with living and died ! We have to learn how to live like that , '' he laughed again . <newline> <newline> `` You wo n't be able to do that ! '' I pleaded , `` just look at these people ! '' <newline> <newline> He laughed , then turned to me , `` Look at the ones on the TV . '' He grabbed my hand , and I watched as his face creased with fear . <newline> <newline> `` You 're just children who 's dead ! '' I screamed into his face as his eyes faded . <|endoftext|>
[WP] It seems like every once in a while someone finds the one person whom they knew in the moment ( that one will be `` lost '' ) . <|startoftext|> I look out the door to catch the last train out the back , and it 's a sight that I do not wish to relive . I 'd never seen anything quite like it . It was dark , there was no sun , but it was like I could see more than my surroundings . <newline> <newline> The first train in the tunnel , the train I used to go to the school where I worked , pulled out from the gravel and dirt , and the two cars that followed behind it in the lane that was in the middle of the tunnel . <newline> <newline> There was a man , he did not have any clothes but no hair and no clothes that would do that to me . In that moment , it was all I had left , and I did not care , there was something I needed right now , something I needed to see in the distance . <newline> <newline> His name was Chris . He was dressed like he did not work , and there was a briefcase attached to the top of his head . He was dressed in a suit , black with brown stains and with a faded-on sign above it . He appeared at the back , and from his jacket he told me to take it , that he was lost to the world , and to come to the light in time . <newline> <newline> I did not take . He pulled away , and I saw that , that he had been staring for a second , and was not moving . He turned away to look at me . I did n't believe him , but I knew he was scared . <newline> <newline> The man was a young man , maybe sixteen or nineteen , and somehow , somehow , he looked so happy . <newline> <newline> I had followed the men everywhere , and there I did not see them again . The men , too , I did not see them again . Chris , Chris who was the third to be lost , is the most beautiful person I have ever seen . He smiles like a school nurse on a cold night . <newline> <newline> Chris , or Chris , who is the fifth to be lost , he is the prettiest girl in the world . In that moment , I could not take the pain of what I saw in the distance . <|endoftext|>
[WP] Tell a horror story in a time-lapse view <|startoftext|> `` Well , it 's really not as bad as we thought . '' <newline> <newline> `` I suppose it is . '' <newline> <newline> He said it right next to me . He was talking to me about the past . If you can call it that . The future . So what if this one really took place in an alternate universe ? That was what I was talking about , right ? I asked him if the alternate timeline was any where to be found . He just shrugged . I guess it was not . Maybe it was the best , though . <newline> <newline> `` Well , that was the real breakthrough . You have made it . It 's not as bad as we ever thought we 'd make it out to be . '' <newline> <newline> I laughed . He was an arrogant prick . <newline> <newline> The room was
