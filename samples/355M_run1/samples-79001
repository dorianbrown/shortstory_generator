line> <newline> The young man glanced up at the man to see what had drawn him here , then returned his gaze to him again - this time looking up at his own hands . He took his time to place the papers with his name on the counter into one hand and his signature in the other . `` I really wish this was an actual job . You have a nice place here and you have a good reputation as a detective . You want to earn some money ? Maybe you 're a pawn shop . Or you just have the best collection of stamps here , and you want to use a fake address anyway . It 's a good spot for a job , if you know what 's good for you . '' <newline> <newline> He put his hands behind him and stepped out of the door to the building across the street . He had to admit , as he made his way through the snow , that this was a pretty good job . <newline> <newline> -- -- -- -- <newline> <newline> The young man stepped out of the front door , walking alongside the old lady and making his way to the back of the store . He turned the knob and walked in . <newline> <newline> `` This is a good place for my son 's birthday , is n't it ? '' <newline> <newline> The old lady smiled with her mouth agape . <newline> <newline> The man looked over at the old lady from the entrance of what looked like a bakery . The man waved . He said , `` Here is my son in a nice little home , and a nice little place for a birthday party . But I have my work done as of late . '' <|endoftext|>
[WP] As a police officer you use your position to try and solve crimes to prevent accidental deaths on the force , with any exceptions you are required to use your badge . <|startoftext|> “ Stop the bullshit , *I'm* the police , ” I said with a sneer . <newline> <newline> He looked at me with disbelief , not wanting to believe what I told him . “ Please don ’ t do this . Please tell me you never kill another man. ” <newline> <newline> “ *No* . You never kill anyone . We ’ re here to find out you . What did you do to John ? You never put a pair of scissors in that woman ’ s hair . You never changed a woman ’ s makeup. ” <newline> <newline> “ Calm down . I have a plan . “ <newline> <newline> He was quiet for a moment then shook his head , still stunned with my statement . “ And if you have a solution I would be more than willing to accept it. ” <newline> <newline> “ That would be nice Mr. Johnson . It would seem you 've had the opportunity to consider our proposal before . Have a nice day. ” <newline> <newline> “ Thank you , ” the police officer pulled me out of the store and into the back of his patrol car . “ It was nice talking to you . I ’ m so glad you didn ’ t kill anyone on duty today . ” <newline> <|endoftext|>
[WP] You wake up this morning and everyone in the house asks what you are wearing . <|startoftext|> My feet hit the floor like I did n't know what the fuck I had just run onto . That 's the first thing I wanted to see , right ? I 'm going to die ? Where am I ? *Maybe someplace ... * I thought , staring through the curtains . I thought about it for a moment and finally let out a sigh . <newline> <newline> `` You are n't wearing anything . Is this a dream ? '' The voice from the other side of the door yelled . <newline> <newline> <newline> I had never expected a reply when I opened the door , but he seemed calm despite the situation in the next room . Not a moment before , this little house had been a piece-of-art . Now , it was n't . <newline> <newline> <newline> `` Why 's that ? '' I asked as he pulled off his coat and looked back at me . <newline> <newline> <newline> `` You have n't seen the last movie ! '' the voice he 'd spoken to me before shouted . He started to laugh . `` The story of the man who lived alone for twenty-two years is in your head you fool ! Your story will be written within ten minutes ! '' <newline> <newline> <newline> ``
