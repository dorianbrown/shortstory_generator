 jits me like crazy , the first word '' `` That 's right . This is the same sort of thing he wrote for the books , a sort of a sequel to his books so I guess we are bound to have it . '' My friend had a bit of a laugh but not one of joy . `` No . '' `` I am not here to tell you the future . It is more than likely that I will not find the time to work as a lawyer after this year . `` <|endoftext|>
[WP] What happens when a world is no longer around , a human is born from what was left ... <|startoftext|> This is it . I look over , and see the only light in this place . A small glowing orange , illuminated by tiny , bright lamps . It 's a very bright light indeed . But , it does n't do the job . This was the last part of life , and now , I am nothing . I can not live the way my parents did , they wanted me to . I can not live . There is nothing left to live for . The lights are getting dim and I 'm forced to sit behind the window . A faint light , but it just keeps getting darker . Another faint light , and another light . Even worse , a light of darkness . I can not look at my screen , nor can I move my lips , but somehow I can see the image above on my screen and remember to turn it to reveal the words `` Stop running . This is n't the end for you . I can keep living . We die and that 's how I die . The lights are closing as my vision is getting darker , the dim lighting a little darker . The dark is too dark for me but I can keep running , it 's just that my hands aches so much to turn them back to the screen . I 'm almost done running . I turn my body , my head . There is no light , I can see no life , no warmth , no sensation . No matter , I should have killed myself by now . I should have killed myself long ago , not by accident . But now I am not allowed to turn back . I must get to the light again . I know that soon I will be able to see a light in my window again . <|endoftext|>
[WP] Write a story about any other story you like , I guess if you can think of that story you do n't have to go exactly in that direction <|startoftext|> It had been 10 months since I had lost my girlfriend . She had been gone for so long , I was almost numb to it now . What kind of person would do this to their own wife , or their child , without a second thought ? What kind of person would do this to those they held dear ? And yet , here I was standing in this kind of a place , like a hospital room . It was dark and cold , but I was not used to that before . I could not remember the words that accompanied them as their screams pierced my eardrums in their agonized screams . I could not hear what they wanted me to say , or just a bit of their anger in some sense . I knew that they wanted me to see them , to know them , to love them . <newline> <newline> I knew that I was dying . I knew that I was so tired . I knew that it was over . I knew that I was not meant to stay here forever . The smell of her body was overpowering me though , the smell of her hair . Her eyes were so bright and clear that I could not tell them apart from me . Her smile . The look she looked into my eyes . The smile that could tear your soul apart . The smell of my body . I had seen this before , and even though I had lost my wife , here she was here with me . <newline> <newline> *He just said , * The sound of tears as the door closed . It was an eternity in the silence , as if I had been dead and then reborn . <newline> <|endoftext|>
[WP] When you die , your soul 's destination is determined by your strongest attribute . An example : The stronger your character 's attribute , the harder you must die . <|startoftext|> It 's been ten years since I 've ever felt my soul left my body . A long time has passed since my entire life of existence was filled with pain , hate , and fear . <newline> <newline> And it 's been ten years since I even saw the truth behind the decision , the truth that caused my pain . My most trusted friend came up to me and told me the truth . The reality is , when you die , your soul 's destination is determined by your strongest attribute . An example : The stronger your character 's strength , the harder you must die . <new
