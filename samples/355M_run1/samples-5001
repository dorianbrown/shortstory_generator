Written from the perspective of his friends . <|startoftext|> *How can you say no when facing a car that has its front left tire just about to tire ? * <newline> <newline> *Just when I thought you would n't care : I needed to get out . I was about to die . Did I want to be in my own car when I got stuck in traffic ? Or maybe it was just the highway , and I was just stuck ? * <newline> <newline> *Or that this car was n't my fault because , oh , I can do that , even if I have n't yet figured out the physics to make a tractor-trailer-the-only-thing-to-procreate . But , I know the feeling and that the thing needs to move . * <newline> *I know that I am a car-car , but I am a car-car nonetheless , and my body is only half-car .

But , I wish you do n't make me . * <newline> <newline> *I wish the car-car did n't tire so badly . Or maybe it was my fault , too , and the car-car was n't the one that should n't tire , too . It is n't a good idea to tire . But , it is better for all of us . * <newline> <newline> *Now that we can tell this car-car I wish you could drive it . And it will still be a car-car , and the next thing I know the next thing I know is that I will never be the friend I once was . But , I must say though , in spite of my bad intentions , you seem to make an amorous alliance with those who helped me escape . * <newline> <newline> *Anyway , I did find you , and I really need a ride to the gas station , so I need to get it to your gas
