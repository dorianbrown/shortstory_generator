 life was going to a place in hell where he would finally learn the truth about himself . <newline> <newline> That 's when he found his answer . <newline> <newline> `` Ah god yes ! Now wait , what the hell is that thing ? '' <newline> <newline> He reached into the side drawer of the drawer and turned out all the other old things . <newline> <newline> One of them caught his eye . He looked down at it , and then it caught him . It was a white cube . <newline> <newline> `` Is this the thing ? '' <newline> <newline> It was almost comical , but something inside him wanted to ask . It was a little harder , than a simple question . How could you know what you wanted to see if you did n't know what you did n't want to see ? How could you know what you really wanted to see if it was impossible to look at it ?

This time , we did n't look at each other when we did . <newline> <newline> `` I never thought you were real ; the way you look , in the lighted hallway . It ’ s like you were the reason for everything we ’ ve ever done . '' I said to her . <newline> <newline> She pulled at her jeans before I could say anything . We leaned against each other , looking down at each other ’ s feet . We were both holding out our hands . Her fingers brushed mine , and her fingertips danced for a moment . <newline> <newline> She paused again , her fingers still on mine . <newline> <newline> `` I ’ m not real . We ’ ve both gone for the same lengths of time in this room - that ’ s the only way we ’ ll ever be real . We ’ re the only two left . You know what I thought ? I ’ m the one who will stop your cycle . '' <newline> <newline> I leaned into her hand , the sound echoing in my ears . <newline> <newline> “ You will stop me now . You ’ re going to stop us both . You ’ re going to stop me now . You ’ re going to stop me . You ’ re going to stop me . I ’ m going to stop you .
