 . My father taught me to hate the truth â€œ and it drove me mad after my parents bought me a piece of paper . <newline> <newline> The day that I went to the doctor , he told me that my brother had died in a car crash three months prior. He was a survivor and now he had to get his family to his brother.He asked me , how did I know ? I lied and told him I had to check for his death last night . When he showed me my body , he asked for my fingerprints , which I refused . After that he called me into his room at night . He wanted to see my prints . I told him that my finger prints were just a few lines . <newline> <newline> When he saw my prints , he grabbed me , and carried me to a nearby church that night , where he placed a candle on the casket , and placed a prayer on the casket 's top . I was told to never disturb the casket again after that . I never did . The next day when I got back home , there was a car accident on my way to my room , which I believe was my dad 's . I do n't understand what changed my sense of the world . I was terrified . The next day I awoke on a hospital bed and I saw my wife , my son , and my wife . I do n't know what happened before that I can understand . <|endoftext|>
[WP] A world where you are the only person capable of making mistakes , and what will happen when you do ? <|startoftext|> There was a time where nothing could truly be done . Those who had tried to prevent the death of a woman were not even considered to have made a mistake , if not with their hands . That was how the past generations of humans had come to be , and this one particular one was no exception . The first of her name meant `` Hope '' as it was called , and it was a word that was passed down from her mother and the parents of the other children : Hope . Hope would be her name that was given to her through her mother 's passing . When she was born , she was born to Hope , and the rest of the people in her family were born . <newline> <newline> <newline> But like everything else in the world , if nothing worked , they would be killed . <newline> <newline> <newline> If people acted , it was in the best interest of all and for this reason Hope 's name was taken instead as a capital M : Hope . It was a simple name with little meaning and this was the result of a system that made it difficult to distinguish the actual word her from a capital A , one that had many of the same meanings as Hope . <newline> <newline> <newline> <|endoftext|>
[WP] You have been invited to the Last World in the Galaxy for the chance to talk with the last human whose life left the planet . In this conversation , you discover that , despite your knowledge of the universe , there is not a single place where this human will die , and that all living creatures , including plants and animals , may live . <|startoftext|> **THE END . ** <newline> <newline> `` You 're an old man . The ones who gave us the stars have said that , for generations , we lost the hope , the good . We 're like the stars , but it had long since ceased to exist because of the greed we had , and how easily we tried , to give our little sun nothing but a chance to shine a bright and glorious light on all our planet . '' <newline> <newline> `` It was a mistake that the stars still had hope , but we have tried . '' <newline> <newline> `` The ones that gave us the stars are trying . The ones who give us the stars are dying . The ones that give the stars are doing it . Those that give the stars are dying in their dying lives . '' <newline> <newline> `` But , we gave them hope , our hope . They were hoping , waiting , that somehow they might be able to live . They knew that they would die . Some believe it was the greed that was killing the stars . '' <newline> <newline> `` These stars did not know to make the first moves , that they could never be able to catch the first steps . They did not think there was hope . '' <newline> <newline> `` And if only the stars would be alive to watch their first deaths , they could n't live the way they know they will . '' <newline> <newline> `` A lot of things have taken place since then . I know that the stars made their way to the last planet that they can live on . But we can never
