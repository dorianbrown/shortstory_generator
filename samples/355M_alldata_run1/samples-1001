 rested of all that is good , but in these last moments the first soul of love and a new one are born . You are given no choice . <newline> <newline> There is a great , unending darkness that surrounds us . There is a great hunger that is forever filled with darkness , that is always hungry ... and always wanting to eat more <newline> <newline> I want to take my sweet life away from you . That is all you have left me . <newline> <newline> If you are lucky enough to have come here one day , I want to talk , and if you are a stranger that just wants to talk to the guy of the day and not to spend the rest of eternity trapped with him , I want to ask you what you want . <newline> <newline> I know what you are like . I can see right through you . I see things that are n't even there . I hear things that are not there . <newline> <newline> As a soul , I am in a position of power . I am the sole creator . No one can live without me . <newline> <newline> You want to talk to me ? <newline> <newline> `` But ... but ... " <newline> <newline> It 's alright though ! I don ’ t mean to talk to anyone . I just want to help out and get some peace . <newline> <newline> If I speak the truth in your mind , that is fine . I do n't care , because I have come here to do what I can . <newline> <newline> We are like the last two people on Earth before we pass away . We have one final purpose . <newline> <newline> `` I want to help . '' <newline> <newline> This is the perfect way to go . <newline> <newline> ''But ... but , '' <newline> <newline> I know that you want more and I want more , even though I am trying my best to tell you that I am not perfect in my choice . <newline> <newline> And I don ’ t want to be perfect either . I want someone to look to my faults and see what makes me who I am , not who I was or why I did n't mean to . <newline> <newline> It would be just as simple as being human - I ’ m just trying to be more human . <newline> <newline> You are not perfect , and if that one person is not perfect , I am not right either . <newline> <newline> The only difference is that that person will be different . <newline> <newline> ''You want to talk to me ? '' <newline> <newline> I ca n't help you . I do n't want to do those things . You are the last three to die . The only reason that I are alive today is because I am a soul . <newline> <newline> I think I know why you love me too . <newline> <newline> I have seen it happen . I just want to help you too . <newline> <newline> Even though we just met at this point , I feel like this soul of mine is your first , and yours to be lost . <newline> <|endoftext|>
[WP] In a world where the only way to die is to be born again , we all have to give up on a dying dream and try something new to live again . You are n't really old , and you are still here . <|startoftext|> `` Why did you have to die ? '' > Your mom . <newline> The other man smiled in his grin and gestured for the baby girl to sit still ... as was his habit . <newline> `` If you were still alive you could have been me , but because I was so much older and had already left the field and died it just made sense that I never needed to do that . '' He stood with the baby , smiling as he picked her up by her feet and carried her to her mother 's chair . As the nurse came back to tell them he smiled as he picked the baby up before looking at her . <newline> `` I think there is something I always did n't want to try to do , and it was always something that I just didn ’ t enjoy doing . I thought I could see things that would kill me before it was too late and that I never really understood . Well i know for sure that this baby will kill my loved one if i take the plunge myself .
