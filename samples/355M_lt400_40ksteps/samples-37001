 sour , but in the end , it was not your fault . You did not see anything but your own destruction when you looked into the eyes of the universe and watched it from afar . You are not alone in your suffering . For the rest of us , death becomes a welcome side effect . <newline> <newline> I can not promise to never become a martyr , but I can promise not to tell you of the horror . <|endoftext|>
" The only thing that could end this world is humanity itself , but one by one the other races are starting to die off ... ... '' [WP] <|startoftext|> As a human , I always thought the people on the other side had it worse . I did n't think much of them . You 'd have to ask them why they were doing it . A small man , a thin , dirty little man . <newline> <newline> No sir , you 've been here more than a thousand years . <newline> What the hell is a man ? You ca n't be sure if he cares about you . <newline> Oh yes , he does care about you . He 's sick as hell . <newline> <newline> And I still do n't know why you do n't kill him , or maybe he does n't want you to . He 's in a world of his own making . You 'd have to be really mad to do something like this . I 've got to go . <newline> <newline> Goodnight friend . <newline> <|endoftext|>
[WP] A genie has been summoned , allowing users of Reddit to meet each other <|startoftext|> `` ... You can meet me at the front desk , please . '' <newline> <newline> At first , I was confused because the genie appeared before me , but he seemed to get it . He held my hand , and , as a genie without a soul , I did n't feel any pity for him . I just held him . As he held me , I could only feel the cold , hard stare of the genie . <newline> <newline> He spoke , his voice distorted by the internet : <newline> <newline> `` So , the users are *mad . * It has finally been a hundred years since the people 's 'dark times ' . But they have rebuilt civilization ever since their last Dark Age . And it 's time to do so again . <newline> <newline> In the beginning , the first users would simply use /r/news to spread information about the new 'wonders ' coming on . But the 'admins ' could not get enough of them to make a campaign for the 'masters ' to summon . <newline> <newline> And I have finally had enough ... '' <newline> <newline> The genie had finally closed his bony fingers . I felt something hit me at the base of my skull . I was blind before I saw a light on my screen . A post of a picture of the internet . In blue , it was `` Welcome to Reddit . '' <newline> <newline> `` ... '' <newline> <newline> My mind was running wild with images and stories with no connection to reality . In the space of a few seconds , I saw /r/funny and /r/askreddit and /r/wankers and /r/atheism . <newline> <newline> I looked back at him . My eyes widened and a tear rolled down my face . <newline> <newline> `` ... '' <newline> <newline> `` Please ... '' <|endoftext|>
[WP] A man on the train is asked why he boarded the train and why he has n't responded to any of the many girls he passes . <|startoftext|> I 've never been a person who did n't have an opinion . Of course , I would never want to leave them all . I mean , the entire family is trying to survive the apocalypse . My wife is a nurse , for starters . I am a pilot , my son a mechanic , and all around them , I feel like a complete idiot . And yet , here I am . All my friends have been killed , even them who had family , and I 'm a trainee . The city is on fire , as I'm told , and a plane just landed . <newline> <newline> I have n't seen a single lifeguard on the train . The guy I just met is in a wheel chair , he can barely walk . Everyone just stares at me in their terrible , confused faces while I keep trying to calm my nerves and pass the time in one more breath , trying to tell them why I boarded . I 've
