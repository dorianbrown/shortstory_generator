[WP] A genepool , where genepwars is born in the same year as your most popular children . <|startoftext|> It had been the worst genepwars that night ever . I was so excited to share this , the only time that I felt like I was participating in this . I had taken everything to see if I had any chance to actually get involved and all I felt was my heart pounding as I watched an entire horde of people die that night . And then it hit me . That it had all been my fault . I had saved too many people and that 's not even the most interesting thing I had learned . I had gotten the wrong end of my sword on a group of people . The one of the genepwars with the sword , who killed everyone with the sword . <newline> <newline> *I swear it must be a joke* I said out loud as I fell over , clutching my sword , which I never had any intentions of ever using , but then I heard a voice and a laugh and someone said `` You 've taken too much ' '' . <newline> <newline> And then I realized I was not so lucky .

So I found a sword and swung back from my knees , I was back in my armor , I looked around at the people still alive ; I did n't do much , I just looked around and waited for the next genepwars . <newline> <newline> The one with the sword died after the first genepwars . The second lived through several other genepwars . But the third did n't , that year he died as a result . And the fourth , the fifth , and most certainly the six died in the same year . And I died . For a year , I stayed dead , I did n't do anything , because I was trapped . I knew there was no escape . But I wanted to get back to my old age . Then one day I looked around . It seemed like only one room had survived , one room was intact , at least the only one I had seen . I
