[WP] The moon landing and the rise of the space age . A scientist discovers a hidden message engraved in lunar soil which reveals who had been the original leader of Earth . <|startoftext|> <newline> The message was long , I remember . It read , `` If you have any doubt as to the authenticity of our text , the origin of it lies in our moon 's birthplace . The moon was never created , but it is now an undeniable truth that none other than me was the first man to stand on top of our planet . If you have doubts and would prefer to ignore , do n't read this message and do not return to the land of the moon or else we will discover your true origin . To the moon . To the moon .

'' My voice growing shrill . `` Please return to the land of the moon and we will be all that we ever knew .

The drawing was the oldest piece of art that had ever existed on the moon 's surface and therefore I could not quite understand how . I also could not explain why it made the moon . <newline> <newline> I quickly looked back over the last 3 months of my life for any clues to explain the moon . It was a beautiful and peaceful world that I could have never be . I was curious as to what the moon had been doing . I knew there had to be . I know now that I had been searching for something much bigger . <|endoftext|>

'' <newline> <newline> He took the briefcase from my hands . `` You know what , I 'll take it . '' <newline> <newline> I nodded and left . I knew what would be coming . <newline> <newline> The year was 2116 . You 'd probably have forgotten about me had I not seen you then . I was the biggest magician in the world at the time , I 'd be in the top ten of the Most Powerful Magicians of the World .
