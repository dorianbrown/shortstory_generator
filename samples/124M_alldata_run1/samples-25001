 lowered the weight on his hand . `` ... I think it 's time for you to go , '' <newline> <newline> He took another , hard . `` Go , or I 'll go too . Good on you . '' He had no choice but to take . <newline> <newline> I turned and faced the door . `` Alright , I 'll go . '' <newline> <newline> *This is too bad ... * I thought as I went . And the door was closed now ? Surely an idiot would have thought this through . <|endoftext|>
[WP] Write a story without the words 'The ' and do n't include the words . <|startoftext|> The room was pitch black , a thin grey against a deep red spectrum . A windowless room , its ceiling illuminated only barely by an illuminated bulbous bulb with a thin thin strip of light falling out , was illuminated only by the lamp . A small wooden chair lay at the base of the chair , facing the room . The table was a worn looking affair with a single white button and a thin , dull metal lid . In front of it sat a small black plastic cup , its lid a thick , white beige with a yellow button . <newline> <newline> I sat down , sitting beside the chair , my hand raised slightly . My hand was shaking . Was this my room ? The one my father used to call home . <newline> <newline> My father did n't seem like a bad man . He was an avid gamer . He had never played a gaming game and enjoyed the thrill of it . Every bit of gaming that he enjoyed , and every bit of gaming that he enjoyed , was n't even a single thing he ever made in his life . <newline> <newline> Now was my time to tell him that it was my place to serve as his assistant in the office . He would always make sure all the systems were in working order and that all staff could make everything perfect . He would also ensure the staff and the game was always in working order . It took him a while to realize just how much he enjoyed gaming , so he did n't get impatient with long periods of waiting for the game to finish and then to actually actually complete it . <newline> <newline> I looked up to the light above me , which was barely visible to the naked eye . I was almost ready to be off my game . <newline> <newline> `` Hello . '' The voice did n't startle me . I was n't a fan of the voice in front of me , and I do n't think he heard me speak . He moved closer to my side as the lamp light was slowly turned off . <newline> <newline> `` Hello there , my child , I am so sorry for the interruption . Shall we begin ? '' I could see his eyes moving through the room , scanning what he was seeing . The light dimmed slightly and disappeared from his gaze . He looked a bit confused , so I continued . `` I had some troubles before I lost my job , but today I managed to overcome it . I did not lose the job , nor even the money , I lost my wife and her husband to an abusive cheating husband ... I have two sons and I did not expect to lose them this way . '' The voice did not leave my hands . `` I had hoped that I could save them , but I did a lot of things and did not expect them to survive , and even if I had , I do not know if I could have kept them alive . '' He walked closer to me , my hands still on his neck , as I was already aware that the voice was n't saying a word . <newline> <newline> I felt my fingers growing heavy . It felt like there was an opening to my mind . I was not even sure if this was going to be my life . I had no way left to live . Nothing could live anymore , even a child . There was no more way to live or to love . The voice came back to me . `` I am finally , my child , a god . You are nothing . I could not save you , you have no purpose , I do not exist . You are nothing . It has been too long since I was a child but please be glad I wo n't have to do anything again . '' <newline> <newline> `` I have done much better than you did ! ! '' The voice did n't have a response from the top of my lungs , but instead went back up to where I was . My eyes snapped open . The room was a mess . A few chairs and a table . The voice continued . I could n't even think to ask why this was happening , but something felt odd this morning , something primal and very deep . <newline> <newline> `` Is this why every hour I am away
