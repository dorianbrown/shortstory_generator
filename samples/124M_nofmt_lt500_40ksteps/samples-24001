 Gods, they're all my allies.. <newline> <newline> They were always my enemies. From the first time I met my enemy he was always my friend of life. But I know the reason he hates me. For now I must become him. <newline> <newline> Today he is waiting for me. Waiting for me to be victorious, to rise beyond him. For today I shall slay him in my own blood. <newline> <newline> "Hey!" <newline> <newline> I am not surprised, a man can turn him to a villain like himself, I will be a hero! <newline> <newline> I think about myself. I am a man, not a man. <newline> <newline> They told me they would never succeed with such a man-like persona. As the hero, so I was not one. A man, a man, you were not the hero of the world but a man who was destined to lead me to victory. <newline> <newline> They told me that it would never be me until the end. That I would always have to defeat the enemies of the world. <newline> <newline> Then, I heard that the person who I despised most of all enemies is no longer at all friendly. He shall be killed. That being said, I still must take a stand. <newline> <newline> To fight against those who threaten to destroy the world. <newline> <newline> "Hey!" <newline> <newline> He is not waiting for me to come. Today he will make me a hero! <newline> <newline> *** <newline> <newline> The last words the last hero uttered was "You're no hero." <newline> <newline> <newline> *** <newline> If you enjoyed this story, check out /r/Written4Reddit for more! *** <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <|endoftext|>
[WP] A character in writing prompts does not actually die . <|startoftext|> I could feel tears welling up in my cheeks. I've thought of her for years and I'm sure that she is still loved by me, but I've become hardened to my feelings. She is an angel that will always love my chest, and I would like to become one. I hate the job I was assigned, but I'm glad that I am part of this team. <newline> <newline> She would have died on her knees if she could see me but she was dead. I still loved her. She died to create this team. Our first meeting was at the hospital, and they had the best care available. Then, our next meeting was with a man to see where they could take one of the doctors. Then there was the meeting with the family and they took care of the young woman and she took care of me. <newline> <newline> And then we came on the road together. It was in time we realized why we had to do this. This team that was supposed to be the angels of God was being ripped apart. It was clear that they failed to give in and start over, and this is what we faced. <newline> <newline> But the problem with having a team is that you can't even give up when you're not really sure what happened. Our team had to work with one another. And now, they couldn't even agree that it should have happened. Now, they couldn't even decide if this was it or if it didn't really need to happen. <|endoftext|>
[WP] You have died , reaching a state of purgatory . Instead of walking into a new area , you now walk into a door , and find yourself face to face with the person whose soul you had left in it . <|startoftext|> I sat cross-legged on a stone floor. My body's still warm, my eyes still were. The pain was too much. I had long since lost my will to fight. It took a year before I knew the pain. Then one day it just came. I could barely feel the sensation or see beyond the light. A man. A white beard. A balding chin. Nothing else seemed odd enough. I took in the feeling as my body felt it's weight. It's pain took over, and then it left me. I wasn't dead by my hand anymore. I was alive. <newline> <newline> I wasn't happy. I was sad. I was tired. I was sad. I was sad. I was sad. I was sad. <newline> <newline> It wasn't a pleasant way to die.
