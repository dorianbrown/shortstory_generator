 <newline> And so the world changed . <newline> <newline> <newline> The same story of two people who met the same fate . The same history unfolded . They fought at the edge of the world in the form of the great war . There were many wars in history , each of which would end the fate of the human race in a heartbeat . <newline> <newline> The same story unfolded . <newline> <newline> Then , in the end , one man was ready . A man who was ready to kill all the humans . His task was completed through the great war . <newline> <newline> -- - <newline> <newline> <newline> By the time this was written it had already been 100 years since the great war . <|endoftext|>
[WP] The story of the two men that took the world by storm during WWII is being re-told , now that the Japanese are invading the Crimea . Now the story is getting a little much . <|startoftext|> Two German tanks rolled together on the roads south of the capital Donetsk , while on the eastern horizon came flying wreckage as the enemy had its explosive tipped guns aimed on their rear . <newline> <newline> The two guns on each side were firing on at the same time , a hail of gunfire and heavy explosions punctuated the skies as they rolled apart like two cars on the highway . <newline> <newline> As the tanks pulled into their lane , they could only just make out a lone figure standing in front of the road , with a rifle in his arm . They both began to turn and face each other . <newline> <newline> `` Shoot ! '' <newline> <newline> The soldier was on his knees , a shell of his former self who had no idea how to deal with shock . He had shot and kicked an enemy trench in the leg . He had been caught by his own guns , the bullets hitting his body in the leg and back , killing him . As soon as he recovered , he had turned to face the man in front of what could be his home . He had shot an enemy trench in the back and his own legs , then a second . <newline> <newline> He reached into his pocket and brought out his weapon . One of the guns blew himself up and the second man fired . But it was too late . He had already killed the first man in front and was shot in the back of the head , leaving him to die . <newline> <newline> In the middle of the second wave of tanks , a platoon of Japanese infantry was waiting for them . Their main guns were on the right , with their artillery to the left , the tanks on the left , and three machine gun nests on the right . <newline> <newline> It took a few moments before the tanks hit the first wave of artillery , but then the artillery fell silent until the troops had moved in and the infantry had to move in the other direction . Both infantry men began to turn to look south . But in one moment , both infantrymen were struck by an atomic bomb , and the explosion had brought them on their feet , rolling and bleeding . The Germans turned to watch , but they could n't see anything . <newline> <newline> `` Sirs ! '' a German soldier said . `` Let 's just get to the right . '' <newline> `` It 's so far away , '' replied the commander . <newline> `` This is our only chance at life , Sir . '' the other man said while shaking his head . `` I can not hope for anything . '' <newline> <newline> The commander turned his gaze to the road south . On it was an armada , with the Japanese infantry on the left , the Russians on the right , and dozens of tanks and infantrymen on each side ; the tanks stopped near the front of the road . <newline> <newline> That had been the first thing he said to two soldiers who were in the artillery platoon . <newline> <newline> `` Move ! '' a sergeant shouted , his helmet covering his face , but still a soldier on his feet . The commander had moved his guns to the right , and the troops had moved in the opposite direction . He had left behind a tank and a man , who was now looking up , his legs dangling from the ceiling . He had taken two steps ahead . The first step gave the man two more kicks , and the second one sent him flying into the air , landing , and he had another kick . The second step had knocked him off his feet , as if to say that the second step might send his feet through his mouth . He was too tired to see his legs again , so the man who was the second step to fall from the sky to his knees , turned to look at his right ,
