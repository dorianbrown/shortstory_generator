[WP] One day , in all your living , you get a text message from yourself , telling you not to open a new tab , and not to delete a new tab or tab tab . Then , the next day , your phone gets a notification , with no subject or message text in it ... It reads `` Text , contact your family for more information '' <|startoftext|> `` What the HELL ! ? '' I screamed , desperately . <newline> <newline> This really needed to be investigated . I looked at my phone and saw a message titled `` No matter what happens '' . <newline> <newline> `` No matter what happens ? '' The message from myself just said . <newline> <newline> `` Oh , and it says so . It 's a message from myself too . '' I pulled up my own contacts . <newline> <newline> It was just a phone call . <newline> <newline> I stared at the call and stared at the phone . Then I noticed a message I had posted last week asking for help . It read `` You are looking for help '' . <newline> <newline> Oh my God . This was it ... <newline> <newline> I waited a few more days , and got a response . It was from my cell . It was saying I was looking for `` help '' ; I got no response , as far as I could tell . <newline> <newline> I sat down on my sofa and stared at the screen , holding a picture of myself and his arm and telling him `` No matter what happens to you , you 're not my problem . '' <newline> <newline> `` What , what 's wrong with your name ? I thought I was in the clear , honey '' he asked . <newline> <newline> `` No . Oh god . I 'm getting so sick of this . I have cancer . I am not going to stop fighting this cancer as long as I live in this pain , because nobody told me the only way to do that is to live in constant fear . The thought that even if I lived this long enough to do what I 'm about to do I 'll get cancer . '' <newline> <newline> `` But ... '' I replied , `` How can this be good ? ! '' <newline> <newline> <newline> A voice of panic was heard before my eyes opened . <newline> <newline> `` I ca n't ... '' my father 's voice said . <newline> <newline> With that I was crying again . I held my hand against the wall , and I saw that the screen had changed . <|endoftext|>

I 'm going to try and make peace with you and- '' It seemed so much like a lot of times before <newline> `` -- my kind is n't gods . We 've lived for so very few centuries and we still do n't fully understand why we were so chosen ... '' <newline> `` -- what was it called when they told us ? I do n't know , but I do n't care you 'll tell me . '' <newline> There was something ... almost comical in the moment . <newline> `` What was it called again ? Oh well , I 've got a little thought for that now . Maybe ... you want a cup of -- '' <newline> As soon as he looked I started to have a very bad headache , I did n't really care about having one of my kind and ... oh my I missed it . <newline> I had just been looking at it all over for a few seconds now . I was going to be able to see it again later . <newline> `` Hey , sorry about that . I guess it was just . I 'm going -- '' <newline> The screen went white , for what seemed like an eternity . I realized I did n't have the light on , I felt my eyes start to get darker and I started coughing . <newline> `` Hey , wait what ? It ca n't be . '' <newline> `` ... '' <|endoftext|>
