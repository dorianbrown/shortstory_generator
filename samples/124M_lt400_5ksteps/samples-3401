The view that only my older brothers would see . The view that only my sisters would see . And then , when I do , I 'll just be away for a second . <newline> <newline> If you 're interested , I can take you into the future , though not as a literal one . A world where everyone is happy .

She did not like to think about it . <newline> <newline> `` It 's just , '' she sighed , trying now less to keep a calm demeanor . `` It is a game that I 'm using my computer to play . If I am playing the game and need a place to go , I will get there . '' <newline> <newline> * '' It 's just a game .
