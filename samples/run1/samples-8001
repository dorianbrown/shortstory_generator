======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 <newline> <newline> She sat down , looking at the floor . `` There 's some work to do '' , she mumbled . `` I think I 'm starting to get depressed . '' <newline> <newline> I sighed and shrugged . `` It should have been a fun game . I think it 's something I should do more often , or maybe more often , '' I said as I began to walk out , walking towards the house , the front door sliding open and my footsteps quickening . <newline> <newline> There was no way in hell that they were going to make it there . It 's almost like someone had left me behind . It would n't even be fair . If they could tell me I *really* wanted a job and I knew I could get it , why else would I have to move to another city ? It was pointless like this . The kids would come and play in the park , the kids would come and play somewhere warm . That was not something I could do . I just needed the job . <newline> <newline> I stopped and walked towards the kitchen . They had a lot of ice cream , it was a lot of ice cream but not ice cream . All I could taste . No , I needed to stop . I thought back to yesterday in the cafeteria that I had found the most delicious ice cream to eat in the cafeteria but it was a shame as it was something I could n't eat . <newline> <newline> She stopped and began smiling , she looked at me once again . I had n't looked at her in days . <newline> <newline> `` Maybe just this would give you one chance to show up . '' <newline> <newline> As far as I could hear I could hear her talking back . <newline> <newline> `` It really is n't a game , it 's something I need to do ... If maybe I 'll do it sooner . '' <newline> <newline> `` I 'm not ready for this '' she said , turning around and looking at me . <newline> <newline> I did n't like watching her but I could tell she did n't know me yet . She walked over . `` Maybe I 'm missing something here '' she said in a serious tone , it was so awkward . She walked closer and closer and closer . <newline> <newline> I knew it would n't come , but as I got to face her , I could feel the heat seeping down my neck . I could feel her grip on my neck . I wanted to scream but everything was so hard , I could feel the cold on my face , but it was too cold to move . `` Do you have it ? '' <newline> <newline> She said , her voice sounded familiar , like she had been talking directly into her mouth in front of her . <newline> <newline> I nodded in agreement . <newline> <newline> She handed me my change and I drank it out just before she went back to hers . We 'd gone into the kitchen when she went to sleep . I had forgotten how to cook . It was only natural that she would need a new chef . I tried , I was really starting to notice her , because she had the same face and the same sense of humor . And she just stared back , the same face . It was n't for anything other than the two of us . <newline> <newline> I opened the fridge , I 'd never seen hers before . I put the ice cream down and I walked to the counter . There was n't a door in the kitchen door . I looked back the day the food left . I was just thinking how weird it was . I had to have someone to talk to about anything . I was thinking ... <newline> <newline> I stepped back and walked towards the door . She 'd put on her mask and I was on my way to the front door . <newline> <newline> `` You 're the only one that can get here today ! Please hurry '' she said , the first thing I saw . A smile was all I saw . <newline> <newline> `` That ... that is n't happening . '' Her voice had something about it , like she was talking to me , but not like I was . I did n't want to believe her . I would n't even recognize her . I did n't want to believe her . <newline> <newline> She turned around and opened the door , she was wearing a light purple dress . The sun had set , leaving my face and face covered in her golden curls and gold chain on . She looked back at me as she stepped out of the fridge . <newline> <newline> I was staring at her . There was no way she could tell me
