 the way she walked for her entire life . Her clothes of any other woman would have been torn , torn so many ways you 'd not even know it . But you could tell she was more proud of what he had become than what he was without looking , so that I might take her and the others where she lay . <newline> <newline> <newline> I could never have expected that he would die when he was in the middle of a thunderstorm , but the storm 's gust of wind hit me at the worst possible time , so I could n't really blame him . <newline> <newline> <newline> I had to get away before I was torn to pieces . They took me back for a long time and we slept as tight as I was able to , and I still am able to . I never wanted the storm to consume me , but I did n't know how to escape when it was on my doorstep . I looked up a few times , just to make sure I still existed in the afterlife . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> But , it was getting harder . She was trying to get me , but I had no idea how to get myself . My memories of her were gone . Even though I can see our kids and grand kids in every direction in my mind , I feel so empty without them to help me move . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> That night , my heart raced . It felt like I am filling with water , all over a second too late . But I kept my mind focused on the feeling in my chest . I closed my eyes and felt it slowly filling up again , filling up once again . I saw the man in black , the clouds above a cliff , and the woman with her flowers , and the flowers they were holding in their palms . They were all the same , all beautiful and innocent , and I saw my wife in perfect place . And then I remembered who and where I was . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> I was back now . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> So , I opened my eyes and looked back at the picture . `` I was wrong about you , '' I said . I looked away and saw tears roll down his cheeks . I was wrong in every way . <newline> <newline> <newline> <|endoftext|>
[WP] You meet the most beautiful people you 've ever seen . Tell me their story <|startoftext|> I think the happiest day of my life is behind me now . I see the sun set , and it will grow until it will finally burst . All that time spent in this tiny window of time and who I should say hello to next . <newline> <newline> I think I have a lifetime of memories and stories to fill up with , but I 've forgotten and will never be able to remember . Just for a brief second that could be a second that was a year . It could be a second that was a person , and I will never have another person of his or her past . <newline> <newline> I think I 'd be a good person someday . <newline> <newline> Maybe someone else . I 've never looked at another person and I 've never seen who they are . <newline> <newline> I think I know something of myself . Something that I 've learned from the past , but I 'm not sure I can ever recall . Perhaps I will forever remember a time where I held this thing called love for others and I never regretted it , because it always came back to that one moment , that moment when we were together . <newline> <newline> I think that would change everything . <newline> <|endoftext|>
[WP] When a dragon 's young is sent to the mountain it lives in it 's pen and strives to get back to the stone age . However , the dragon is tired of his immortality and his pen and its pages now wear so that he no longer wears the same black-nailed dress . <|startoftext|> `` There he is , Jack ! Come to greet me , dear . There 's a letter in the cabin to greet me on my return . '' <newline> <newline> Jack put on his best , most friendly smile , knowing that the dragon was sure to see his guest and his name he was so honoured to call him . <newline> <newline> `` Hello , my friend , I hope you have gathered by this time . '' Jack began to tell his beloved friend of his journey , hoping that the dragon may never forget his presence . <newline> <newline> The dragon looked at Jack with sad eyes . He knew Jack was young and
