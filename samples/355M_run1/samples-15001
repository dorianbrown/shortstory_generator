 , I finally felt that I could trust her , that my love for her was genuine . I knew I would be a good man , and that I would someday feel some form of happiness . <newline> <newline> She went for the bathroom when I came out , as she always did when I came into the bathroom . I noticed something strange . She looked into the mirror , which was a little bit bigger this time . It was made of the same material as the mirror . She looked back at me and smiled , like it was something that had happened to her . It was actually my wife , who had come into the bathroom so many times before . <newline> <newline> `` Honey , if you think i 'm stupid , you 're going to need a seat mate . '' <newline> <newline> She smiled , and looked at me and said `` I did n't want to hear your stupid bullshit again . '' <newline> <newline> `` You 're just being stupid man , now go sit on that old pile of gold and give it to Mom . It 'll last much longer . '' <newline> <newline> She sat down next to me , and took the large and heavy pile of gold which I 'll never clean . I love her . <|endoftext|>
[WP] One day , you wake up to find that you , your entire family , and every single person you love are scattered about the streets . <|startoftext|> I looked out the window , only to find that it was actually a nice morning . I knew what I was going to do though . I decided to get up early , because I did n't want to get sleepy today . In those moments though , nothing happens and I feel really alone . I decide to take a walk through the streets for lunch . <newline> <newline> The only thing that seems to bother me , are all the people everywhere around me . Every day I would go for a walk through the streets , and that would mostly go unnoticed . And after that , the people would disappear . <newline> <newline> I walked for about two kilometers , when I saw one , and I looked behind it , all the different people were scattered about , including some other people I never saw in the first place . <newline> <newline> I tried to get to them , as a matter of fact I tried to get to my mommy and daddy . <newline> <newline> There is no way to figure it out . <newline> <newline> Then I got to the other side of the street and walked for what seemed to be an hour , but that was just the walk that would follow . I walked through a bunch of houses , people , and sometimes people who I recognized from the last time . <newline> <newline> It was at one of the houses , after going through a few others . I looked over me , a few people were in the other house , I walked through one , and I saw someone else in the other house . I walked around the house again , this time , I saw somebody in the other house . <newline> <newline> The house was filled with people , but some people were out , and they were staring at me . It looked very strange , like an evil place . <newline> <newline> I ran through another house , but the people in the other house were all at the other house , looking back at me . <newline> <newline> I went through another house to see a girl that I did n't recognize . I just walked for a bit , looking at her , and this was n't weird enough , I did n't recognize anybody . I found her again , but the girls were n't looking at me , so I just walked out of that house . This girl was not on a list . I could n't figure out what to do yet . <newline> <newline> I looked back out of the house , and there were no people looking back . As I walked down the streets , I noticed that it seemed to be a very dark and gloomy day . There was no bright light yet , or any signs of a life , at least , I did n't know of any . There were tons of people on the streets looking back at me , as if they wanted me to know that they loved me enough to see me again . <newline> <newline> I started walking towards the car in the other house . <newline> <newline> I did n't think . I did n't think I could ever get to that place . I did . I started walking until I came back to the street , at which point I realized that I had n't been there before , and that there were no people who were looking back at me anymore . <newline> <newline> I started walking home
