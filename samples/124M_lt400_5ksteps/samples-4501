 <newline> <newline> He 's not going to find me there tonight . He 's not going to find me . Oh , he 's not going to find me at first . He 's not going to find me at last , or , no , he 's not going to find me in one of the most expensive hotels in the world . I 've grown to hate myself . I never wanted to be here , I never wanted to be in it . What did I have to give me ? I was only meant to be one of many , and I never knew that I was one of *them* . <newline> <newline> All he got was a phone call . He wanted me one . He asked me to come to his hotel . He took me with him . He drove me to the place where I can find out if I 'm going to be in there tonight , and I know that my best chance for survival will be if I do n't tell him . I know my best chance for survival is always *it* . But , *someone* *is going to take me , *that* *someone* *is* going to take him . I 'll be dead . <|endoftext|>
[WP] I 'm an asshole , but I have a friend . <|startoftext|> `` Is not my friend , or vice versa . '' I spat on the ground , hoping to be heard but it was n't ; my friend was n't there . <newline> <newline> We walked into the lobby of the hotel-a group of men walked up , staring intently at my . I turned to them and asked , `` Mr. & Mrs. Trump is in . '' <newline> <newline> One of them turned and ran through my heart , `` Do you know where his room is ? '' He said in what seemed like a friendly voice . <newline> <newline> `` I 'm guessing , '' I said , `` it 's in the office . '' <newline> <newline> He walked over to my computer screen and started typing . <newline> <newline> `` Mr. Trump is the oldest man living . In fact , he 's the oldest in the world . '' <newline> <newline> I went onto read through a dictionary in frustration . I had never heard of anyone writing . I quickly typed on that internet encyclopedia . `` I am just this old man , but I am older . I am the oldest man in the world . '' <newline> <newline> `` And the greatest of these are ... friends ? '' <newline> <newline> I had n't told anyone yet , or even started to believe . It was too soon to tell until a voice in my head told me to look it up . It was too soon , and I knew it . <newline> <newline> So , in that moment , I had an idea : I needed to tell my friend . I did n't have the motivation to do it , except to tell him that I had no friends , and he should trust me . <newline> <newline> <newline> <|endoftext|>

[WP] God is actually trying to help you find a better and more sustainable solution to immortality . You see a new drug that has been released : Death . <|startoftext|> `` Death has the ability to kill a living being , '' God said , laughing . `` But why ? '' <newline> <newline> The idea was n't that hard . How could we die when we were all alive but it was easier than with death ? Or maybe death was something we were born for . But it needed immortality , and I 'm not kidding when I said that it was the perfect thing we could create : immortality from
