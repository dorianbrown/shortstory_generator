======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 worked the same kind of job as the other members of the same company , all at different companies , and I was doing it just as an intern . Everyone I knew did , or could , had a job . But I had one of myself , even though I was an intern . I was different , and everyone knew how much that was supposed to help -- but I did n't know how it would affect me ... <newline> <|endoftext|>
[WP] The year is 3142 . America has collapsed and is ruled by terrorists . You are a former soldier dealing with the aftermath of the country 's collapse . You are working as a courier for `` The Company '' . <|startoftext|> I do n't remember telling the generals about this one . <newline> <newline> The story did n't actually start coming this way , but it 's hard to get used to hearing it anyway . <newline> <newline> First I 'd have to convince them that I have no business telling the truth . There 's not an ounce of evidence that we are doing that at all . It does n't sound very logical . <newline> <newline> Second , no-one is really sure about who I am . How do you even keep an army if nobody tells their soldiers to . I could be an angel of justice , doing whatever the hell I want . <newline> <newline> Third , I need to stop pretending that they 're okay without the evidence . Sure they are , but they 're also doing the wrong thing because they do n't want to know what I 'm doing . <newline> <newline> In any case , they do n't have the guts . It 's kind of like what it is to have a superpower for a while , I guess . So yeah , I can see why there 's shit going on there and I just need to figure out what to do . <|endoftext|>
[WP] What are your greatest fears ? <|startoftext|> I want to die . I always wanted to die . And there 's no one to help me . <newline> <newline> When I 'm old enough to feel old , to feel the wrinkles of my hair begin to creep up on my arms and legs . <newline> When the day hits and I grow to know the life I have to give up will never change , it wo n't . That 's all I needed to pass the time . <newline> <newline> I love my job . I love my job and I love my dog . I love my life . I have too much work , too much day , too much time . I just have to have them all , just in this room , every inch of the way of life , everything will be worth it . <newline> <newline> I guess I 'll just stay here and think . I 'll see if there 's anyone else here and maybe the others can feel . Or I 'll just stay here and think and hope for the best . <newline> <newline> No regrets , really . <|endoftext|>
[WP] The last thing you remember hearing was the helicopter blades clanking and crackle , the chutes going down , the ground shaking . Before you there was something else , something terrifying , and it may just be the best thing to ever be . After hours of surviving everything that might have happened since the plane 's crash , it turns out that that thing you thought was the helicopter was not actually your helicopter at all . <|startoftext|> `` Do you love her ? '' <newline> <newline> They never asked this , they never even saw her . The helicopter would 've crashed within their reach if they 'd gone down into the field . `` Yes I do , I do , I do '' was the only answer they could have gotten . <newline> <newline> The helicopter began to roll down , not even bothering to look through the chutes . You just know , you 're dying , or as close to death as you would ever get . So , before any of you could say a single word , your final moments of hope were interrupted . <newline> <newline> You could n't hear the screech , you could n't see the thud as the helicopter landed . But at least you got to keep watching . <newline> <newline> -- -- - <newline> <newline> Hey OP ! I hope this was n't a cheesy movie montage . <|endoftext|>
[WP] Humanity 's last message to the gods was `` Please stop killing me . My time is up '' <|startoftext|> The last few seconds before the end were just moments , the last seconds of all eternity . We did our
