 down his hood of a tattered old hoodie that was covered with a yellow slouch when she pulled him in for a handshake before the two men shook hands , his smile not leaving his lips as he grabbed hold of her shoulders . <newline> <newline> `` We 've done it , '' the man said , his voice breaking . `` We 've done it .

[ FF ] In 200 words or less , write my personal letter . <|startoftext|> Dear My friend , <newline> <newline> We are living a life of hardworking . With this life we have been living , living with this life . I have spent all this time on this journey , so I have a few more weeks on my hands . I think I may need to leave you soon , if only at once , but I love you so much . I know there are better time to get on this journey , I only wish that I could have seen my life end before it started . But I miss you so much . <newline> I really need you , because of you we have been getting together for a year now . I know you are the best friend I have , so now I do n't have to pretend that you still love me . You are so kind even though we were in the same time . <newline> And you are so beautiful . Now you are mine , and your dreams . You 've been so bright , it has taken me so many of you to realize that they are not . I love you so much , more than I did in mine . As much as I love you , you love me , and I love you so much . <newline> And you were with me last week . <newline> I was sitting in the kitchen when you came in and told me you had an appointment . <newline> <newline> Just kidding . We were getting a phone call out with your doctor , and I had to hold your hand when you put her in a hotel room instead , because you were standing there waiting for her so you can get there . <newline> <newline> I really need you , because I hope you do the same to me . You are n't really my daughter , and my husband , but you are my daughter . You came in the other night to our office a few minutes before we were due to leave . I think I went to sleep knowing you would n't care about me . <newline> You are my best friend , and I truly love you , it 's like my favorite song . <newline> Thank you for everything I 've been through , I 'll miss you more than anything . My kids are going to be fine in a little while though , if it does n't get this much worse than this . I really miss you . <newline> My most sincere , <newline> <newline> <newline> David . <newline> <newline> <newline> -- -- <newline> <newline> I love you , and as much as I love you I 'll miss you . <newline> <newline> I will miss you dearly . It 's gotten quite a lot worse since I did n't tell you I love you , so I do n't really know what to do with myself . I was really scared when I found out at the end of December that this letter was coming . I have never really been the person that you always knew . I just did n't know how to keep that secret from you . Every so often my heart would skip a beat and it would be a full blown panic attack . <newline> <newline> And that 's how I found out . I found you on December 31st , but I just did n't know , so I just sent it out . I was just waiting for you to find out again . <newline> <newline> I tried everything I could , and I did n't see how things would go out . <newline> <newline> It was just so frustrating , but then it was gone , but then I found out I did n't get anything for free , only a small box of candy . Now I 'm stuck here , holding it in my hand , hoping whatever happened there is right . Oh , I just love you . I 'll miss you for sure . <newline> <newline> I 'm sorry I 'm not able to tell you , but I 'm really sorry I ca n't tell you , and I 'm sorry for you . I was just looking for you , you were n't really around . <|endoftext|>
[WP] In the future , it appears a video from your smartphone shows you the last thing you 've seen before dying . It reads a news report detailing a plane crash at JFK airport . This is what makes it so special
