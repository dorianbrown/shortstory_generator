 sir I have to go now or I 'll end up missing the game . '' I smiled . `` I just need to get one more shot in before they come back , you know ? I 'm not sure I 'm even ready for a 1 's game , but let 's not worry about it now . This is a one time . '' <newline> <newline> *One Shot game . * One Shot game ? <newline> <newline> The game I have been waiting for . <newline> <newline> As I left the game , my heart was racing again . <newline> <newline> *This is gon na be a good game , is n't it ? * <newline> <newline> `` It is ! '' I said , feeling a little guilty in my mouth . <newline> <newline> I thought to myself that it was an amazing game . <newline> <newline> <|endoftext|>
[WP] A girl gets a new name and wants to know what it says . <|startoftext|> They 're there waiting for you , with some people even thinking you 're crazy , like this old woman who took her name from my name , because it said ` I must run through the forest to find myself . ' ' And I 'm not crazy ; I 'm just curious what happened to me when I was 15 . <newline> <newline> My father died when I was a boy too , and my older brother and I were orphaned from the age where we knew our mothers were going to be . It was easy for me to find something in what little paper I received , and what little I found there led me to my family , my family and my brothers and sisters . Now , we all say that , without question , that in order for something to happen , it must be something I want to know about . <newline> <newline> I 'm just a girl , in this little way , that somehow found all my knowledge by asking me to help her in the same way as you help your children . <newline> <newline> *So what do you mean you ca n't do the things you do ? * That was in the end the biggest , most frustrating thing about having these kids at home , no one else with the responsibility . *I want to go to the park and take a shower , like your boy , and that 's impossible because there 's this other boy coming back . * <newline> <newline> Well , I can think and I know that I am an incredible help to these children , I can make them live without fear of death , I can stop any fear that they may have , when every day is the only time they see the world for what it is . <newline> <newline> I 'm asking you to help me find them . I want to be your father . <newline> <newline> <newline> [ To Be Continued ] <|endoftext|>
[WP] You wake from a time coma to the world you 've lived in as a teenager . You have just graduated and you 've been playing with your toy line . You are n't sure what to do . <|startoftext|> I remember . I see my older brother . I feel his presence as I move forward and closer to the couch . Just sitting there , with my eyes locked . I feel his hand on my ankle . <newline> <newline> `` Hey , honey , have you ever felt like this ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Never . '' <newline> <newline> That makes sense to me . You know how your brain can only process one kind of information per second ? Think of an image you saw as a kid , before puberty ? Well , the brain only processes what you see , before you feel the image , before your senses , and you could tell if it truly felt true for you . <newline> <newline> I notice as he watches me walk . `` Honey , are you seeing something ? '' <newline> <newline> I see it too . <newline> <newline> I have never seen the mind . Just as I noticed on the couch . I hear a noise . <newline> <newline> `` Is that a cat ? '' The cat ? Me ? You would n't expect to hear this from the one you 've been spending days playing with . You 'd expect to hear the cat barking after you have moved the cat to a different part of the room . <newline> <newline> `` Yes . It 's me , Tom ! '' The cat 's voice sounds like something out of a James Bond movie . <newline> <newline> And I 'm in my own movie . This is not where
