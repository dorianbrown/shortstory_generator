[WP] You are an assassin on the run from Death following you into hiding , only to discover that all of his minions have disappeared into thin air , disappearing into thin air before you do . You have to find them . <|startoftext|> You never stop your trail, Death. You must never be caught. <newline> <newline> Death was a cruel, mysterious being. You are as far from him as we're going to go. There are others, but they are always watching. Watching and waiting for your return. <newline> <newline> Do not come near. They know you will not come near you this time. They know you will arrive on time. And they are so worried about you that they will not let you leave for another time. <newline> <newline> When you see Death, take a step towards the one who would give you birth. Step towards him who watches you so closely. You only have one life. Only a life, and only you can make it. <newline> <newline> It's an empty place. <newline> <newline> They think it is. But it is alive. <newline> <newline> There is no other life left. <newline> <newline> You may come close, but your life is short. Perhaps it will not be long left before you reach him. <newline> <newline> It is so lonely. <newline> <newline> You can not die alone. <newline> <newline> No one knows if you are watching, or waiting. <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <|endoftext|>
[WP] We live in a moment when everything is about to change , when everything has a purpose and a purpose is about to happen . A minute watch was developed to identify what 's happening sooner . You have just been called in and have 5 minutes to prepare <|startoftext|> It was a little routine to be prepared in the morning. <newline> <newline> It was only a little time, and I had already prepared for what was to come. With a practiced smile, I looked over my shoulder and started to set, ready to start over. <newline> <newline> My mom had been in my hospital the last week, and she wasn't as happy as I. I had no idea whether this was a blessing or curse of a gift, so I had only thought that some of the things were going to change. I was just about to head back to my room, to make sure everything was in order, when the news came back. <newline> <newline> "Mom!" <newline> <newline> "Oh my god, is someone out there!?" <newline> <newline> I heard a laugh go through the kitchen. It was my mom! She made fun of me over the weekend! What did she do? She always made excuses, and even so now. Maybe, she felt this way. But then, something was different. It was like it was an invisible speck, a little something. Like it wasn't there before, and something was gone. <newline> <newline> I walked over to my mother, looking at her worried face. She must be scared, or angry, or scared for her daughter. <newline> <newline> "M..ma.." She stuttered. Her tone didn't sound good. I stood over as best I could and turned around, looking at the clock. <newline> <newline> It was 6:30 in the morning. I took a deep breath, trying to calm myself, to calm my nerves. <newline> <newline> "GIVE ME MY CAR BACK! I need it badly. I just know that you'll have to." <newline> <newline> I reached over to my mother. She saw me move the car, and gave me permission to follow. I waited, trying to understand what she would say. I told her she could be there, and that there was a reason for me to stay. If she knew, I would always be there. <newline> <newline> It was only a matter of time before my daughter would follow me. <|endoftext|>
