 "I've already killed all three of you bastards!" <newline> <newline> The rest of the team was silent, and the captain stood motionless as he watched the situation unfolding. "Yes I have, sir," He replied. "But if you could just..." He interrupted himself to tell the captain, a few seconds later, he heard the voice of the captain. <newline> <newline> "I don't know, sir. I don't think I would like to do this much longer..." The captain continued to stare at the man who had interrupted him. It was at this moment that the captain began to feel dread. <newline> <newline> "Well at least then I'll think." The man growled. "Look at that. Now it seems I've killed the leader before I got to that location. Well now for the third one." <newline> <newline> "Oh great," the captain said with a grin. "Perhaps if you didn't run the town to the last one, you could at least make it to the point I made everyone on the inside so I could kill the one who killed me. But I know how you're planning to kill that loser." He pointed to him, who was still staring at the man who had interrupted him. "Now I have a duty to serve." <newline> <newline> The captain gave him a smile. He didn't want to do whatever this man did. <newline> <newline> -- - <newline> <newline> "He's not dead," the captain was heard say to his subordinates. They all knew what was coming, and their fear filled heart beat was the only thing he could produce. "He's in the air, but the captain's got an air attack planned. We need a response. We don't have a response, so I'll let them in. If they find him in the air, then we need to get the air forces out first. If they try to do that, well... we have to deal with you guys." <newline> <newline> The crew stood silent, looking at the captain. All but one of them began to weep. The captain was going to end it all now. <newline> <newline> -- - <newline> <newline> The plan had already been laid. <newline> <newline> <|endoftext|>
[WP] You are a person suffering from anxiety and you have a hard time focusing , you ca n't concentrate because of this anxiety . You try to write your own story that will make it through in five words what the author does n't know . <|startoftext|> I tried to focus on my writing, my reading was slow. Just a weak effort that the author thought should have been more focus on. Just an effort that was supposed to be good. <newline> <newline> <newline> There. I tried. The author tried to focus. His writing was not fast. His writing was more of a slower and slower process. And yet he was focused. I could see my hand trying to steady itself as something I thought wouldn't exist. As if he was in control. I felt the urge to pull the writing from itself, the pen turning to paper. I didn't know what the author wanted me to do. He felt me trying to write things so fast. So fast. And why did he have to use so poorly or otherwise fail to finish my own story. <newline> I started to feel numb in that moment. I couldn't. That was when I realized how much of an idiot the author was. And so I continued to think, with all my focus. I tried. As the author began to write down my stories, not even noticing, it was too late. My mental state was shattered. My brain was starting to go completely mad with fear. And nothing ever goes back to normal. I thought I was going mad. I thought I was going mad. <newline> <newline> <newline> I tried to focus again. Trying to get my mind sharper. <newline> <newline> <newline> The author stopped me. He stopped, and he wasn't even looking at me. He was staring at me. I could only see through those eyes, and if my mind hadn't had any trouble putting on the words that formed these words ; <newline> <newline> <newline> It was a beautiful day. I tried to focus, but to no avail. I struggled up onto my bed, to sleep under my eyes. <newline> I didn't sleep under my eyes. My brain tried to stop me. I tried to sleep at night. I tried to sleep at night. <newline> I couldn't sleep. <newline> I don't sleep. I am unable to sleep now.
