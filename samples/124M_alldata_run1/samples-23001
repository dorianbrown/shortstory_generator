======== SAMPLE 1 ========
line> <newline> <newline> As my vision turned to a blinding white , the world around me faded . <newline> <newline> I can not think . I can not feel . I can only hear . <newline> <newline> I do not know . <newline> <newline> And then , without the pain I 've been feeling ever since that time , I woke up in my crib , in an hospital room filled with the sweetest baby , her little girl , crying out in the hospital room . <newline> <newline> She is still crying , her face redder than it 's ever been . Tears now pooling down her cheeks to wipe blood off her eyes . Her arms now curled up and her head in the crib . How could she be crying . <newline> <newline> The nurses look at her and their mouths open like they would swallow anything to get her to stop crying . <newline> <newline> `` Please , dear , '' she is sobbing , `` please , do n't do it again . '' <newline> <newline> So I sit on this chair , with everything on it . I 'm not sure if her words come from me anymore or from her crying voice . This has been a long time , but I think she 's crying too . <newline> <newline> So this is where I keep her heart , knowing we 're meant to be together . This is where I 'll be watching her heart , waiting to tell her that her child will be just like her before a long time ago in the womb . <newline> <newline> She 'll be so happy again this little girl . <|endoftext|>
[WP] You are the world 's superhero , you know how it works , do n't you ? <|startoftext|> The sound of gunfire was heard all throughout the streets , and no one seemed to realize that this was indeed where they had been shot . It became more intense then usual . <newline> <newline> It was a sight for many to see . And even more people to see . <newline> <newline> The man , just as he had always been , was the world 's hero . Most superheroes have a good job and a good job , but for him , it was nothing short of a blessing . <newline> <newline> When he was finally selected for the world 's most dangerous assignment , a hero only needs 20 seconds ; a lot longer than when you choose the first man you get and they 're all out . <newline> <newline> In many ways , he was the most dangerous supervillain in the world . He had just enough money to buy a whole team of superheroes , and was willing to help himself , just to keep the world safe . He knew that the world as we know it was safe from him ; it was n't safe from any other superhero whose name he called them . It was n't safe from any superhero . <newline> <newline> He was going to keep taking the money , and not giving him anything back . <newline> <newline> After getting the super-villain of the world , when the heroes got bad results , when he was being very , very good at it . The world knew what was coming , but they were ready . <newline> <newline> That was the end of it all . He had to be the villain . He had to be an honorable hero . <newline> <newline> And a hero who knew his name as the man he was . <newline> <newline> The only problem was , he felt that this would be the one time he had ever been really able to keep his secret . It could have been the whole time , he would be able to survive , and still he would . He would not be a coward . <newline> <newline> But it never had been like this , the world 's heroes were n't afraid of being villains , and they were n't . They were heroes who were n't afraid of having their powers . They were n't afraid of being the villains , or just plain stupid , so they knew that in the end , they would have the same powers and the same powers as anyone else . <newline> <newline> And they all did . <newline> <newline> -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - <newline> <newline> As always , comments , criticism , and suggestions for my next prompt were very welcome . The feedback is welcome ; even if it 's a bit short . <|endoftext|>
