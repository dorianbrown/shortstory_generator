[WP] Every night , you see your cat sleeping in your bed ( open-door ) sleeping bag . You turn on the lights and sit under the covers . <|startoftext|> I wake my beloved cat up , I ’ ll be honest – it ’ s been weeks now . Not many cat lovers have a cat as large as me , but it doesn ’ t have to be as big as the ones in their small living room , or as large as the ones under the covers . My cats have evolved to love to stretch on each other , so they are very easy . <newline> <newline> I ’ m pretty sure that there are few more of us , though they are becoming increasingly more afraid of each other , and they are getting progressively smaller . The only reason they need a place here is due to the fact that the house is on the outskirts . There are only seven or eight people left . <newline> <newline> I ’ m surprised my cat has a tail . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <|endoftext|>
[WP] You 're a supervillan , and have been in charge of a secret government project , the government is secretly hiring you . <|startoftext|> I woke up early this morning . And then , it was just plain as the paper they were printing . They gave me a little promotion with them , and it was $ 3M in savings . You know , a measly amount to start . <newline> <newline> I ’ m not really sure what kind of jobs are considered glamorous . <newline> <newline> When they say that I ’ m a supervillan , I ’ m trying to see that as what happens to me . A supervillan is someone in a super suit with a super voice to fight a supervillain . I had no clue what it was they meant when it came out that I was now in charge of a secret government project . I thought it was a joke . <newline> <newline> Then , I got an email notification . <newline> <newline> **DEALER OF BLACK** <newline> <newline> <newline> I just remembered something that I ’ d always written about . The government wanted me to go against my heart . It ’ s a secret , I ’ d never been to it . <newline> <newline> I sat by the fire and cooked some soup . The people in the office had decided that this is my calling , so I just started writing as I walked the two blocks to my home . I got to my home , and then I walked away . <newline> <newline> **DEALER OF BLACK** <newline> <newline> <|endoftext|>
[WP] You discover your wife has a secret weapon ... a camera . <|startoftext|> `` Let me see , here is my camera , '' the camera was held up . She turned her head to the side and started to get a look at the time . The screen read 7:15 a.m. in the morning . She could barely feel her hand as time seemed to slow to the point of not being even real . She glanced down the road to check on the weather . <newline> <newline> She paused before turning back on her camera after her eyes narrowed at the last photo she took in her office . Her eyes widened at the title being written on the screen as she looked at the headline , `` First Time Mom . '' The headline read `` First time , the most amazing wife you could ever meet '' ( was I that lucky ? ) <newline> <newline> It took awhile to read her post about her . She was writing about something that would be interesting , something she was curious to read about or , if she was looking at the news at that time she might think about a bit while watching the feed . <newline> <newline> If I wanted to look at the blog entry I would have done a bit more research , as to what it is . I checked the comment thread and was surprised at the number of comments about her . The number of mentions of her were almost as much as it was the number she actually wrote about . <newline> <newline> Then I started to realize that the headline on the screen had been updated before . It read , `` First Time Mom , you will have the most amazing wife
