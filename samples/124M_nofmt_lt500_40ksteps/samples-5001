======== SAMPLE 1 ========

[WP] A soldier on a mission dies when he spots the corpse of his family . <|startoftext|> "Sir, you're so confused, I should tell you about the war." <newline> <newline> "Sir it is important, and it's about the only things that matter." I paused to catch my breath. I felt the tension in the air as I stared at my mother, who lay in her bed with a grim gaze at the sky, the sky that had been blue, and the sky that had been grey, and the sky that had been black, still black. She wore all black clothes, and was no longer wearing the black robe. The light in her eyes was too bright, too painful. <newline> <newline> "Are you not afraid?" <newline> <newline> "I am. Thank you, Sir." <newline> <newline> "We need you, and it's the only thing that can stop this madness." She looked at me again, as I lay in her arms, still in my bed, but it was all black. There was no light, no sound, but my memories were all black. The grey, still grey, was my only memory of my life, of the war before it started. I remembered the moment, the pain and the death. <newline> <|endoftext|>
[WP] In his drunken stupor , George Washington walks down a darkened hallway and sees the man who killed him . A woman approaches , offers to help and they both agree . The man in the woman 's arm hands caresses her arm . <|startoftext|> *She's gone* she screamed as he lifted her arm, pulling her back out of her hole. <newline> <newline> I stood there, staring. I was about to say yes to anything, but her arm and the blackened floor of my room did not seem very inviting. "Where are you? Where are we? I didn't come for you." <newline> <newline> "Please. Go fuck me!" she begged. <newline> <newline> She grabbed my wrists, forcing them to hold me, and held my hair back until it hit her bare, then pulled my shoulders up. <newline> <newline> "No. I don't have food. Why did you say no? I would have never let you die. But you didn't have to do it." <newline> <newline> A sob fell over him, and I took him to some new place, hoping the nurse would help him with something. I could tell he was crying but he was happy only for me to be here. And he would find an ending. <newline> <newline> Suddenly a scream rang out. And the scream was different. It was different because it was louder. In his mind it was not like a scream. It was more like noise. "Please don't be..." it sounded like in his head. <newline> <newline> "I love you... I'm sorry for you..." he said. <newline> <newline> "Don't..." I said, sobbing, "Please don't let me die!" <newline> <newline> "No!" she said as she pulled me away. "I don't want this." <newline> <newline> "I'm sorry," he replied weakly, falling to the floor. "I'm sorry, I can't bear to tell you this." <newline> <newline> And I stood there staring at him, not knowing how to tell him. <newline> <newline> I looked back and saw nothing. I looked back again. No one had come yet. And I looked back and saw nothing. <newline> <newline> "Please take me.." <newline> <newline> His words rang like a gun. His eyes were red, too blue and too white. His hands were clenched, and he felt his arms tremble as he pulled me towards him, to bring me back to my brother, to my father, to my lover. And I was the only one with them. <newline> <newline> The sound of a gun was heard as it pulled me to him. "You can't save me." <newline> <newline> "No." <newline> <newline> I turned around to see him again. His eyes were black, too green. How did he know of my presence? He was still breathing out, but was moving. Like a machine. Still breathing out. <newline> <newline> He had me at his side and held me, one hand and one arm. His skin was red, too red, and his fingers were red too red. And his body was torn asunder.
