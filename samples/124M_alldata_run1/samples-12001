 thoughts . This is n't like any other story I 've been able to write . It 's more of a personal project that takes a lot of effort and effort to write . When I went to sleep that first morning I could n't have asked for a better night out . I had just awoken to start my morning rounds of laundry and was n't going to wake up to my parents again . They were n't around , they went to bed and I could hear them talking , they were n't there . I was n't supposed to be able to sleep that way . <newline> <newline> And now I get that they were n't here last night , I 'm not sure if the news has been wrong all night , if my parents are still around . But they were in bed , they knew what they were supposed to do . Their hands grabbed the television remote and started to toss it into the nightstand , then grabbed me . I pulled my hand away , hands down , gripping it . <newline> I looked like a scared child right before my eyes . My mother took that look and I was confused . <newline> `` Honey , how are you doing this all day ? '' <newline> `` I ... I ca ... '' <newline> `` I 'm sorry , what are you doing ? '' <newline> `` Oh , that thing in my room . '' <newline> `` No ! It has n't happened yet ! '' <newline> <newline> The door opened slowly and a man stood there , in a white coat , carrying a mace . The man walked around the room to put the mace away a few seconds before the gun went off and the gunman , who was holding a gun pointed in the room at the woman ... <newline> `` Honey , what are you doing ? '' <newline> But his footsteps were cut off as the gunman pulled a gun to the woman 's head and they ran away , he 'm still dead . I saw the gun move behind the woman 's head as the bullet went out of the gun and through the window . I screamed for the others but they all just stared at me as they went . <newline> <newline> Suddenly I feel bad , the blood on my hands was coming to me all the while thinking the same things . <newline> `` Why am I here ? '' <newline> `` Why am I afraid to do what needs doing ? '' <newline> Just as I was on my way to get my M16 and a few magazines , my hands became hot sweat . This time I stopped the tears and took the blood . I took his hand and told that his name was Richard and he was going to be here with me when I wake up , we do n't have any chance right now . <newline> And so , he was . <|endoftext|>
[WP] An assassin is hired to kill a high-profile celebrity . It ends with him accidentally killing a fan . <|startoftext|> It started like an ordinary day . For once , the public eye was focused on this kid . It was n't exactly unusual for a high-profile person to stumble across the scene of a criminal act . People were usually quick to report a crime on their own terms . It was almost as an afterthought . <newline> <newline> Everyone in the world was too busy to notice that this kid , or what he was doing , was in town . They were just as much interested in the event as the police . Some people had the same reaction as him . <newline> <newline> After a few weeks he hit his girlfriend , but it did n't do much for him physically . People got a picture of him in the newspaper . He made a few TV appearances a while ago . He got back into hiding . People went nuts everywhere he went . No one can predict what might come next . <newline> <newline> He hit a lot of people with a gun and went to prison . People were shocked to see him in prison . It only took two months until he was finally released . Someone else in the news wanted to report that he was an actor with a terrible reputation . Someone knew that he was an actor . <newline> <newline> He got to the top . The same press and the same public . It was like the day the media got him in jail . I mean , he got out of jail in a little bit . He went through a lot of problems before he was able to get out of jail . When they got him back , though , well , first of all , they did n't really want to believe that , right ? They 'd have n't been able to prove it to their people . `` It 's a big shot ! Someone went crazy , or something . `` , was what I saw through the years . This guy 's career had really peaked
