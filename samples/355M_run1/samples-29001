 a new home in the galaxy . <newline> <newline> For me , it was n't that big a change.Everything was the same at the same place . All of my knowledge was always there . Even now I was able to look at the same objects I 'd seen before . The same objects he 'd seen earlier . The same objects he 'd seen 10 years ago , a few months ago or a few weeks ago . But there was still something different about his eyes . It was the same as any other man 's eyes . He was the first man to see his own eyes . <newline> <newline> I 'd been waiting with my crew for a long time . I was finally going to make him proud . The ship we were going through would be returning , but not before they 'd see me . I 'd never expected so much to be brought back , much less seen . I looked around the ship , looking for the only possibility . The only option I could give them . <newline> <newline> A moment later I heard my ship 's engines come to life . Slowly , then with quick strength one could almost see the entire front of the ship . The entire ship was starting to move . I could n't believe what I 'd waited this long for . I pulled out my lightsaber , and stood up from the pedestal in the center of the ship . I approached my wife . I told her the news . She looked at me , with tears in her eyes . <newline> <newline> I saw a distant explosion from my ship as he turned to stand next to me . I took the empty tray in my hands and opened it up . Inside lay a strange green substance . It felt like a liquid , but it had not yet entered my skin . It felt like it needed the same time to enter my body as my ship had . <newline> <newline> In one instant I was in that ship , but in another I was in my room . <|endoftext|>
[WP] In an alternate universe , the Roman empire was defeated at the Battle of Cannae . The remaining emperor was a Gaulish soldier . Tell the story of how he or she got into the emperor 's private chambers and how he/she/it defeated the last emperor . <|startoftext|> `` Hey , my name is Gaul , what 's the news ? '' <newline> `` The Giiiiiiiiiaiaiaiaiaiaiaiaiaiaiaiaiaiaiaiaiaiaiaiaiaiaiaiaiaiaiaia ella laia lula ! '' <newline> The Gaulish Emperor spoke . His voice sounded harsh but he knew it came from an eager young man under a hood that had wrapped around his neck like leather . <newline> An older man , a man who 'd been in his 40 's , spoke through a translator . <newline> `` I 'm sorry , I mean your wife . As I understand it the marriage was n't legal in the empire so I 'm afraid we really won . No-one will deny that to you . But we 've managed to convince the king that there is a loophole . He 's very much against it . And for our sake it did n't have to be an empty marriage . I had to give up the emperor 's favor from the beginning . A woman like him makes a very good wife ; he is an excellent wine . '' <newline> The Emperor nodded . <newline> `` So you 'll have to take our job in Gaul 's favor , right ? '' <newline> The Greek translator nodded sadly . <newline> `` Yes , I am very much in favor . But as we all know , for one day the entire galaxy is ours . I would very much like to see this fight again . '' <|endoftext|>
[WP] The devil was actually a liberal arts student at Harvard University , he was never there for the real reason . <|startoftext|> `` No ! '' <newline> <newline> `` NO ! That 's what you said ! Did you have a reason *no* ? '' <newline> <newline> He did n't move a single muscle . In fact , he looked rather pale . It 'd be a month or two before his mind rewinded , but he 'd need to prove he was *very* sure . There was a reason why all those damned liberal arts students at Harvard took so *liberal* of an attitude . <newline> <newline> `` What did you say , '' he repeated his question . `` A good friend of yours ? Would n't that mean we ought to be able to communicate with *you* ? Does that mean you and I can continue the *meeting* ? '' <newline> <newline> John felt something
