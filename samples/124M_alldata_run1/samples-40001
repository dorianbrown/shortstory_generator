 darkness of the void . <newline> <newline> A lone crow , a lone crow , and a lone crow were the crewmen and friends of the crew . In a world now filled with billions of human souls , to this day , a solitary crow was still a lonely shell of the old man . The rest of the crew , their crewmen , their friends , their lives , had all moved on to a new life . This new life that would replace the old one . <newline> <newline> The ship was now in the stars . The ship lay on the dock . The dock had been a great journey since it was a small colony of the most advanced species of the galaxy . The crewmen and the friends of the crew had done so far in the past . The old man sat in the middle of the dock , waiting to come back to this new life for which he was only just now beginning to see . <newline> <newline> The ship rocked slowly , as if a weight had pulled all the power from the ship . A wave of pure ecstasy washed over the crew members , the crewmen and the friends of the crew had no idea what to expect . The ship was floating off , so completely out of sight , that the ship felt like the bones of a dead man . The ship was in the middle of the galaxy , only to be obliterated by waves of a rock or air . <newline> <newline> The ship floated , so slowly , in the void . It 's weight was such that all the crewmen felt their strength fail and their bodies being crushed to the ground as the ship sunk into the void . A single figure stepped out in the middle of the bow of the ship . His voice was deep , and he was full of energy . His eyes were cold , and he was filled with the smell of ash , so much ash that it was unbearable for the ships captain in his state . <newline> <newline> `` We have made new home . '' His voice was deep , and he was full of energy . `` It is home to the people , and we shall see them thrive . '' <newline> <newline> All the crewmen turned to one another and the captain turned to the man on the bridge . He turned and spoke . <newline> <newline> `` Our home is here . We shall see them for generations and generations . In this vessel , humanity 's greatest accomplishment shall be history . They will be known as the first explorers of the new future . After that , when we pass through this new void , we shall make our home . We are the stars of the universe .

[WP] Create a story where a character is on the verge of losing something . <|startoftext|> “ And , as usual , sir , you must follow. ” <newline> <newline> “ Right. ” I said . <newline> <newline> “ Good work. ” The man on his desk replied . A tall , white man sitting next to him . His balding head and thick black hair , that was a little to thick and seemed to hang on more to me than just a short haircut ( he was a lot too fast for this place now ) , and his eyes gleamed with the brilliance and power of a beacon in the distance . He was dressed in a red shirt , suit , and tie that was too tight to fit , and shoes that were too loose to fit . He had a small bowler hat , a long white beard , and a tiny pair of sunglasses . A pair on too close to his face , too small to fit . Something I had never seen . <newline> <newline> “ Is it all the same as we were hoping ? ” I said . <newline> <newline> “ Yes. ” he said . “ It will be more than that. ” <newline> <newline> I was more prepared . “ I have no idea . All I know is that this job will benefit me and that I will take your hand in the coming election. ” <newline> <newline> “ Do you feel that way ? ” I asked . <newline> <newline> “ Well , it seems that I have lost the support of some of the people you ’ re elected president to represent me so that I won ’ t have to make any decisions regarding your position . I was only the nominee when the election started , but now that I have the position , I see something that I have never seen before : I have lost more power than I ’ ve gained .
