======== SAMPLE 1 ========
.... I love you. My dear. My love. <newline> ( <newline> The boy has only just left me, and he is already in the backseat of my car. I'm so surprised I don't see the light in that dark black hoodie. It never rains outside and I am so young and sleepy. In the middle of a forest, and only about to wake up from a nap. This night is as beautiful as the day before, and I want to say goodbye to all of my life, but I know I won't. I will always be so grateful to God for His help, when the time is right, I will let go of it and go to Heaven. Goodbye, my love, thank you - <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <|endoftext|>
[WP] You die . Your last breath . <|startoftext|> When I awoke, I was feeling like shit when I pulled my head out of my ass. My feet weren't much more than a handful of years old, and I could probably feel something against those muscles the way I normally did, just not quite feeling them yet. I was feeling pretty damn shitty. I couldn't put into words what it was. I sat on a chair. It was the most boring seat I had ever had, and it all happened so fast and without warning. <newline> <newline> I opened my eyes -- oh god, this wasn't a good idea. "Is this fucking going over?" <newline> <newline> I opened my eyes, but I could still feel things underneath. My hair was starting to curl under my eyes, and my lips were starting to come out. That was the first thing I noticed. And the last thing I can remember, the first thing I remembered, was this awful, awful feeling in my throat. <newline> <newline> The blood rushed into my eyes, and I collapsed onto the floor, screaming into this bed. I knew that it was because of this. <newline> <newline> But I wasn't breathing. I was... not breathing, at least. As I held the door shut, I noticed the ceiling suddenly shifted to a far left, where I held down the bed against the wall. I was crying. It had been a while, but it was finally gone. The wall was the wall I'd used to have to hide so I didn't fall further in the floor. There would always be a door on the wall. <newline> <newline> I was holding the room's door open, and I saw that as soon as I opened the door, I stood right there, still breathing. <newline> <newline> The walls had shifted left. I felt dizzy. I was shaking the chair, trying my best to bring back the chair so I wouldn't be hurt. I had been shaking the chair for almost a year now. I couldn't hold it anymore ; I couldn't feel like anything was off. It hurt, just like it hurt. <newline> <newline> But I was starting to find my way into the house. I looked from outside, down the hall to the back porch where the sun was shining on the horizon. I had to walk, because it was dark. <newline> <newline> I walked across the door to my room. The door closed abruptly, as I realized why. I couldn't open it. As though I'd just gotten lost in the shadows. <newline> <newline> "Where is my room?" I mumbled. <|endoftext|>
[WP] SatChat : What comes first ? ( ) No , this is why you must have been reading the reddit r/LunaWritesMeFirst subreddit . <|startoftext|> "You better get up" I said <newline> <newline> That's when I saw the writing in the newspaper. It was a post about the story of a woman in her 40s who came out of middle age and started taking her life. It appeared at the end of the article and the post disappeared. <newline> <newline> The author was gone from the page, so I just had to search my phone, but I found it, at my local store where there's a book/ newspaper on the back cover. I couldn't open it because of the cover, but I knew from that day that I wouldn't need to open it either way. That's when I was about to take the life of the person I knew best. The title : LunaWritesMeFirst and I thought I'd save the person who had done everything I could to kill me. <newline> <newline> "What's the story of?" I asked <newline> <newline> "Well, I was trying to find a book
