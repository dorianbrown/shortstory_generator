======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 constantly and every day like clockwork . <newline> <newline> I have become a recluse ; my memories are as if someone has been in a bed every day for the past ten years , and I have gone mad . <newline> <newline> I wake to the sound of traffic in the distance , my eyes dart between cars as they pass by . I have started to feel like I am drowning in a black sea , only drowning here because the sun is up in the sky . <newline> <newline> And I have no friends ; not just my parents , but people I never knew at all , or even knew myself . <newline> <newline> I wake to people , who say to me they have never heard of you . They say I am strange , like one of them . I feel a certain amount of sadness , and a certain amount of relief , and I fear I am the last one who truly knows me . <newline> <newline> I do not know what I will face next , after all these years . <newline> <newline> Perhaps it will be my last time ... <newline> <newline> <|endoftext|>
[WP] The villain is the only one truly evil in the world ... but still ... Evil still wins . <|startoftext|> I 've never really understood what is good , evil , or just plain evil , but I do n't think I 've ever seen it more as an evil thing . You see when you stare at a fire , the flame turns from orange and purple , your brain goes numb and you remember what you 're doing . All you 're seeing is the fire , but it 's never yellow . It 's grey with just a little bluish black . Its black seems to come from behind the flames , but that 's an interesting thing . People do n't know about the flames yet . It was actually pretty dark out when they saw it . It 's only been 3 days since it started , and I 've come to know more about the phenomenon out there on the ground . I do n't know how it has affected my day to day living . We are all just people who are living on the street or in this very street . A few of us have had to leave every day , but we have n't been the same , and the only thing that we 're here are us , with our family and friends . <newline> <newline> I do n't know what happened to me . I 've lived so long , and I have n't done anything wrong . I know some things , and I 've been doing all I can to help this poor guy . People , people I know are always asking me questions , but no one is answering . They only get one answer . That 's what I know , because the people I know are n't there . <newline> <newline> I remember that night of last year . I remember the fire , and the crowd gathering around . I remember how happy and joyful the crowds looked , and when I came into the fire , I was happy . I was content with that . I mean all of us , we all made a change , all of us . Some of us had to leave , but not everyone , of course . I had to save a person , and get on with the rest . It was n't my decision , but I could n't stop . That 's why I wanted to stay . <newline> <newline> I can do this now . I can save someone . Some would say that I need a change . But I know them and I know the consequences . I know the fire started in my dreams . I know that I 'm the evil one , the one who made the world a better place . I 've lost a lot of people in this past year . Not just because of the fire , but because if I 'm wrong , that 's an empty , pointless , waste of time . <|endoftext|>
[WP] We have discovered the secret of hope , and it is spreading again ... <|startoftext|> We all know . <newline> <newline> Hope is an intangible thing that exists to be lost somewhere or another , but we all know that it exists . <newline> <newline> They say that if you were to get out of a place you 'd never return to , it would all be like this . There were so many things to do . But nothing seemed to really make sense , and that was pretty much the truth . <newline> <newline> It was like finding the hidden power hidden in the depths of a cave . But the deeper you were , the richer it became . <newline> <newline> You 'd think that these men would realize how important it is to us that we can keep on going and going
