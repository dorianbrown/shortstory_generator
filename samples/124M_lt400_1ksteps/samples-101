 life and love , and I see no one in the world who is a stranger to my love and my love has seen that you are a friend and a lover to me . You never lost me , never . <newline> <newline> <newline> <|endoftext|>
[WP] The first person you ever met looks a bit more like your father than something you know will be a part of the story . <|startoftext|> He was like a child , smiling , but a little bit of a grown man . His face looked different than yours when he was younger ; his face was bright , but more like one that has a lot on it . He was the youngest in the room -- like your younger brother . He was a bit skinny . He was a bit thin , but not too thin . <newline> You remember the last time we met ? He had a baby on the couch and we all had to look and look at each other and be like , no , I know , we all did and everything was fine , he just didn't look me . He was a little bit different . His skin was more youthful , his eyes black , his hair a lot darker . I thought he was a bit immature , but at the same time he was always at my side . He was a bit too young , so I do n't know how it happened . I do n't know what made him so different . <newline> <newline> <|endoftext|>
[WP] Write a story with the phrase , " You do n't know how to feel about this anymore ," and it ends with , " But I do . <|startoftext|> `` We never had anyone that wanted to 'know' . If you ever ask , 'How am I doing so far , 'I know you have no idea because I 'm sitting here . ' I don't even know why your mother keeps saying that you 're a loser . '' The question was asking . I was n't doing this . I was just keeping up . A year older than you and I have always been on the same page . Why are you telling me that you 're not doing this ? <newline> <newline> What ? How are you acting like this ? What are u saying ? <newline> <newline> `` I do n't know why I keep saying you 're a loser . You do n't know how to feel about this anymore . I know you have no idea that in just the last week I took that shot you should have been fired . . '' <newline> <newline> Another question I should have been asking . I mean why are you telling me that the last two shots . I 'm fucking dead now . I am not . You never have to say something as important to one as a question . Just ask . Why does this one matter in so many ways ? How does it matter . Why do these things have to happen ? Why do you have to be so goddamn smart and shit with me so fast ? What was going on ? <newline> <newline> And I do n't believe you . I do n't even think I am . It 's not even about whether or not I am , the question is why . <|endoftext|>
[WP] At the end of the night , you wake up and discover there is a massive power spike . You could not sleep . Your body is running . What would have happened to you ? <|startoftext|> `` The last one '' <newline> <newline> *I do n't understand , it was n't that long ago * <newline> <newline> The energy was not great and the power was bad . You could kill me <newline> <newline> * <newline> Then , it did n't happen <newline> <newline> You were just weak and weak , then <newline> <newline> Your body felt terrible . <newline> <newline> You can never be strong or strong alone . <newline> <newline> The last is the day . You die and the world goes back . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> You wake up , you feel the power surge over the world . <newline> You wake up again , and your body is running . <newline> The power is n't big again . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> You 're weak . You 're weak ! <newline> <newline> You can die ! <newline> * <newline> The last one , the end is n't that long ago . <newline> <newline> * You 're no longer weak . <newline> <newline> *You 're not weak , you do n
