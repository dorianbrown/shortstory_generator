Forgive me , I did n't mean to do this . I just have to give you this chance ... to live on in the shadows until my demise . '' <newline> <newline> `` No . You have already made an oath to protect the people . '' <newline> <newline> `` Oh ... Oh I know . Well , it 's good that I have a chance after all . But what is it you want to do ?
