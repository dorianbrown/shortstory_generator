'' I cried out , still reeling from my new form . `` Why ! ? '' <newline> <newline> I continued to listen to the heartbeat outside my ears . <newline> <newline> For a full ten seconds I just sat there . <newline> <newline> Then one of the thugs stepped forward and said `` You 've got two minutes to tell us what 's going on ! '' <newline> <newline> I had to lie down to survive the onslaught of beatings in my head . <newline> <newline> The thug said . `` Okay , let 's do this . '' <newline> <newline> They threw punches that hurt me to my bones with all of their might . <newline> <newline> The second time the thug said , `` Do n't worry , we only got time to get you up , I think it has to do with the fact you did n't listen to our last conversation .
