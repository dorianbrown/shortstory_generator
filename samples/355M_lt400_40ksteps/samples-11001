> When they were young they saw my father sitting in those tall green robes sitting on the side on the patio chair and he sat down and started talking to them about the world ... about the world , that is ... and how he was just one normal middle class kid ... <newline> <newline> I do n't know how long I've heard that . <newline> <newline> I do n't know how long I 've heard about that but one thing I love more than ever is the way their faces changed without me looking at them ... the way their faces came alive when they knew I was going to come up to them and say hi . As time goes by people get older and they become more and more scared and I think I see my father smile at that young girl from last week and she goes into a fit of giggles and runs away crying with a big smile onto the floor . <newline> <|endoftext|>
[WP] A new disease has devastated the world . Humans have become self-aware with no reason to interact with one another . <|startoftext|> `` Hey man , '' the man croaked . `` So this is pretty big . '' <newline> <newline> `` You know ? '' I said . <newline> <newline> He stood up and leaned in a little bit closer . <newline> `` Do you want anything ? '' he said . <newline> <newline> I shook my head , and walked into my kitchen . `` No '' . I said . <newline> <newline> He sighed quietly and placed the empty container of food to the sink . He took it back out of his jacket pocket and handed it to me . `` You ready ? '' and I nodded . I placed him down and opened the door . <newline> <newline> I was already in my apartment when the virus occurred . My mother called me . She told me I could n't do something like that , that a doctor told her not to do it . What does one do when they ca n't even understand their own actions ? <newline> <newline> This is the fifth time I 've called . This time I can only say the words out loud . The voices would n't have this conversation . This time I do n't feel so alone . <newline> I 'm not sure what happened . <newline> <newline> `` Are you alright ? '' <newline> <newline> I smiled . <|endoftext|>
[WP] I 'm not sure I 'm capable of writing . What if I were ? <|startoftext|> **I 'm not sure I can write . ** I say , in a hushed voice *shuffling through the room* ... <newline> <newline> Is that my name now ? `` I 'm not sure I can write '' *shuffling* . *shuffling through the room* . No . *huffling* . *shuffling through the room* **Is n't that odd , that sounds like an odd name* . *huffling through the room* **I have no clue what this is . Is that what I am calling to now ? *huffling through the room* . I do n't know if I have a name anymore . Does this also work in other languages ? *huffling through the room . ** There is no more room to breathe , only space . *huffling through the room . ** No ... ** Is that even where I am ? *huffling through the room . ** No , it wo n't be like this forever . *huffling through the room* I 'm not sure what this is , that sounds like an odd name . <newline> <newline> Does it work in other languages ? *huffling into silence* **No *huffling out of the room* . *huffling* **Yes . ** It does . *huffling in the room* **Are these walls covered in blood and lies ? *huffling through the room . ** No , it wo n't be such a large place , and the room will always be empty . *shuffling and huffling through the room* ** No , there 's no door or window in this room anymore . Would the walls always be covered in blood and lies ? ** They 'd be covered in blood . *Huffling through the room* **No .
