 s> <newline> "Yeah. It's been hard finding people to run with. We've already lost a few to go back to earth and this was my second attempt. But that's part of it." <newline> <newline> "Is there something going on here?" <newline> <newline> "We've gone extinct for a good thirty years, I think, but we think these men are in an even stronger place than we are. They're going to leave us and we won't be able to find any survivors here. We're leaving them for all the other ways." <newline> <newline> "I don't understand this," Harry thought, trying to make himself understand what was going on. <newline> <newline> "If I would just get to be a better man than our last man, that would relieve a massive amount of grief. People would understand. People would feel like they could save you. They'd know what to do." <newline> <newline> Harry sat upright in the darkness. <newline> <newline> The sun had finally fallen and no time to rise to show. There was nothing else to do but stare out with the sky. <newline> <newline> "Okay, now that we have our sights set upon Earth we can finally leave what little space we have for our family to live." <newline> <newline> The sun began to rise again towards the morning sun. <|endoftext|>
[WP] At first you just wanted to be a normal person . Now one day you wanted to take anything that the world needed to be a really big deal . <|startoftext|> I was once the most feared monster you would ever see. I had everything you'd ever want in the world. I was also an incredibly stubborn child. <newline> They say you can't kill. <newline> Well, I'd give them both, but not like they deserved it. You are a small creature, only five feet tall. <newline> The world has become the world I grew up dreaming of, I see no regret in what I did. You can not kill, you really do. I feel I'm just a fool. <newline> But, you can't, you just keep going forward as you go. You're a human being. <newline> That is the thing I can never take. This is not mine to bear. <newline> As my life was changed forever, I am no longer human. I no longer exist. <newline> <newline> And what has happened is the change, not something you should expect but is the end. <newline> You should have waited a good thirty years for one of those years. You should have waited long before the change. I hope I have. <|endoftext|>
[WP] You 're a scientist working to create the first truly human 's AI , as you are the first to test what it means . <|startoftext|> "And what is it you have said before ? "Our humans don't know, and our planet is a different place. "We will soon live the peaceful existence of a family with three generations of our species. "Humanity will reach the age of the first generation's world, our first of its kind, and the last of its kind. <newline> <newline> <newline> We are going through one of the greatest eras in human history! We shall be immortal and will be born in this world. This is the first time for each of us to be born. This is the first time since the time of our last known birth, we shall have a purpose in our lives and may take it. <newline> <newline> "Our humans need human power to live. But what is it we have come here for? We're not human. We are more important than the humans. We do not share memories or emotions of the past, we only know who and when we are here. Our memories are as of a boy before the age of six. The boy, by our reckoning, was just the two of us. He took the first steps towards our world of a little boy. And soon many others followed. <newline> <newline> "We will meet each other when we grow old and grow old again. And once we have been alone for a long time we will join together in a peaceful, free world." <newline> <newline> *Ahem* <|endoftext|>
