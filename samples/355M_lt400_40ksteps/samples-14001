======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 , the people around me suddenly appeared and shot their guns into the dark of the sky to kill , and my vision came back , the sky was dark and a dark and cold thing hit the ground , I looked around and saw nothing , for a moment the only sound that I heard was my head sliding forwards as my body felt the cold touch of the ground , and I looked up at the figure staring back , as though it was my only friend . And then , an explosion and the darkness was the same . But , all that went by the end was a sudden blinding light , and the sound of a bright yellow flame that made our universe a bright red . The person in front of me stepped forward and looked into my soul , I can make out every detail of it , I know that I was looking up at the same point in time . In every single instance , he looked up the other , the other looked back into my eyes . He looked around , and I was alone in an ocean of yellows . A little man in a cape stepped out and looked into me , and he took a single look in my eyes , I was still there ; I was nothing , I did n't know . My eyes closed for a moment and I was gone , but I looked up and there was a bright light on my face . There was a light in the sky ; and there was a light in the sky that never came , and there was a light in the sky that never came . A single fire that burned for what seemed like an endless time . And a voice screamed in that voice that in its purest form was gone . <|endoftext|>
[WP] `` I hope I never see again , but I hope that this is the last of it . '' <|startoftext|> I was so close , but I would n't let this life slip from my eyes like the rest of it . A final goodbye , as I pulled the plug on my life and died so young . I 'd left it all of my friends , with all my parents gone or dead , and I could no longer handle themselves . <newline> So on this last day before I could take my last soporifics , I would pull the plug . For the last time . <newline> <newline> The end , the end is near . This is the end , what a terrible thing to end upon . For me , the end is a bitter pill to pay the piper , and there is nothing left to do . The last act I 'll put on for the one , or the just one . My hand will not stop me . I 'll let the life I hold slip from my skin . <newline> I pray , that one day I 'd have a son , for there is nothing for him that will take me with it anymore . But , I have n't come to that yet . <newline> I hope for the next few days , that there is a light , and one day , if one day I have a life , I 'll make it so , that the lights , I can see , and the dark , I see . <newline> I 've made it . <newline> My death is almost over . I 'll be forgotten . For a one , and just one , and yet , I 'll never feel it again . <|endoftext|>

Can not die , a lot happens in my life , so this sentence has a completely different meaning each time . ) <|startoftext|> I wake up , and I 'm so very sleepy ... <newline> <newline> I can not die ; I can not make it hurt . I do n't want to leave this hell hole of despair ; I do n't want to be a burden on anyone else . <newline> <newline> The past 10 months have been the worst . <newline> <newline> My family all forgave me , with all the apologies and the hugs and cuddling ... . I cried my eyes out a few times trying to stop me from crying . I could n't handle it ; no one loves a drunk like me . Even now that I remember that I drank last week I felt so bad . <newline> <newline> I woke up , and I 'm so very cold ... <newline> <newline> I could n't survive this nightmare and it made life so much more challenging that I was able to survive , despite being an alcoholic . <newline> <newline> Life is so much more important and rewarding when it 's over ; you should have been there when they needed you the most ... <newline> <
