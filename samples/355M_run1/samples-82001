 crawled down the street , and I could hear her calling . <newline> <newline> `` Daddy ! Why are you calling ? '' my daughters cries were the most important thing I 'd ever heard in my entire life . I could n't imagine the things I could tell her . Perhaps that will save her , I thought to myself . <newline> <newline> `` Daddy help me with my mom ! '' She began screaming and running towards the corner store , and I could hear her calling again . We rushed in , and as we entered , we heard a gunshot . This was not what I was looking for . My mind went to the police . This could be the perfect nightmare . <newline> <newline> <newline> `` I 'm not going in ! '' The shopkeeper called for help from inside , and it arrived . I heard a voice outside . It came from the door . `` Open it I '' . There was the sound of the door closing , but I could only hear the voice of my daughters mother . <newline> <newline> I felt a chill rising across my body . I heard the door slammed shut . The clock struck 5:32 . I felt a bead of water run down my chest . <|endoftext|>
[ IP ] After the Battle by Zephyri ( DeviantArt ) <|startoftext|> A man and his rifle . That . That is all it would take to win the fight . <newline> <newline> The man had been doing so for what felt like an eternity , fighting the Empire . The war was hell on a lot of a few worlds , not the least bit of death on the scale you would see here . This planet was not like the others though . Sure , the man killed many of his men and men of his tribe but those fights were brutal . <newline> <newline> He would kill those men because he saw them as enemies , enemies who would n't let him take it . It was n't until they had already been slaughtering him that he knew that they did n't need his orders . No matter what they asked , his man would fight them . <newline> <newline> He 'd always had the will to do what he thought was right . He had n't had one to do that for so long . Maybe that 's why he was there in all this time , killing those men and men of his tribe . Maybe that 's why he defeated them . <newline> <newline> Why the Empire needed a man like him is that there 's no else to kill . <|endoftext|>
[WP] The human race was n't originally intended to have one thing in common , as newborn humans share DNA with an artificial entity . After a time travel accident leads to this conclusion , no one really knows what that second entity was . <|startoftext|> The little robot in the room looked at me with disbelief , it seemed to think I had broken some form of code by messing with its programming , much to my 'great surprise ' . But the question I had about the robot continued to plague me , and my mind struggled to think back over the steps I had taken to erase this second entity . <newline> <newline> *How did I get through that ? Where did I find it ? * <newline> <newline> `` It was a good question . What was once a robot , now became a robot and is on it way to its own creator . '' I was told . <newline> <newline> *How does one robot become a robot ? * <newline> <newline> `` It was just a matter of time . I would be able to think it , and the answer would be a very good question . '' I told this to the robot , *I wonder if they know if that 's possible ? * <newline> <newline> *Where can we find it ? * <newline> <newline> `` There 's a small hole where the power switch is , there 's a large panel in there which is plugged into the wall . '' <newline> <newline> *What do those come in this room ? * <newline> <newline> `` My creator , he has only me as long as the robot remains in this room . To keep him alive , he had me work for him . '' <newline> <newline> *What was it ? * <newline> <newline> `` They could just plug into the wall . '' <newline> <newline> *What is this ? * <newline> <newline> `` I suppose you can think of it as his brain . But he 's also me , from the moment you wake up in this room . '' <newline> <newline> *How else am I supposed
