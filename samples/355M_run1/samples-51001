 <newline> In the distance , the two could see an eerie glow . But before he could turn , there was a sudden flash . And in the instant he saw the light , there was a long , warm , white thing wrapped around his legs and slowly moving to the ground , then turning , leaving a trail behind it . It was his head , and he could feel it in his gut , but still he looked down at the lifeless body hanging from the ceiling of his bathroom , and felt the tingly feeling that he should probably vomit . <newline> <newline> `` Where *were* you going ? '' <newline> <newline> Asking questions was his only way of dealing with the dead . `` Home . '' `` I did n't find you . '' `` I 'm sorry . I just need to get my thoughts out .

You 've already called for help . '' <|endoftext|>

The stars are always bright and perfect but these ones are dim , dim , bright . That 's how they make sense . <newline> <newline> When one is young , the stars help him develop what he will become . But as the days pass one 's eyes begin to be dull and his eyes begin to become weary , the stars are always there to tell him to never open his eyes - no .
