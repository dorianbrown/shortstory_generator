 unit to the world in no time at all . He had a new job too , as a security guard for a major power station to monitor for new threats . <newline> <newline> As the sun set over the land , the man looked up from his work and spotted the giant , glowing green star on his desk . With a nod to the Captain , he stood to give me a glance . `` You 're a welcome sight to the airlock on the way there . '' <|endoftext|>
[WP] It 's the middle of the night . The moon is on its brightest . A soldier stands with his rifle rested on a nearby grave . His eyes open and the moonlight floods his face . <|startoftext|> His eyes open and the moonlight floods his face . He grabs the shovel he 's been carrying , and digs through the dirt to find the man on the ground . <newline> His knees buckle under his weight . The soldier reaches out and grabs the shovel . Inside the grave is the last remnants of the life of his family and it feels different than the time they lost their mother , sister , and mother dog in the war . <newline> His head hangs low as the knife flies into the dirt . The soldier picks the shovel up and looks at the moon . <newline> Suddenly he feels something heavy . It is the weapon resting on his chest . As he looks into the distance the knife slips from his hand . He has it there . Then , there 's cold metal against his skin . The soldier 's hands begin to tremble like he just realized it was not his first time trying to use a knife . <newline> It 's the first time he used a weapon in one of these trenches over this short time . <newline> He picks the shovel up again and makes another pull to find the first body . His eyes start to adjust when the sight of his first dead soldier is first brought to his mind . He takes a second to see what he 's looking at . <newline> <newline> Then suddenly he realizes he 's not a soldier at all . <|endoftext|>
[WP] A ghost inhabits a dead-end job . <|startoftext|> I 'm sitting at my desk writing this , I just wanted to relax and relax before my lunch break , so I can spend time with my family . <newline> <newline> I did n't leave my lunch in the morning because of the cold . I 've heard that the cold is actually an energy booster and can protect me from freezing . I had to go into my office at 9am at all times ( except when I got a cold ) . <newline> <newline> I 'm sitting outside my bedroom making sure that I get all my necessary tools . I was going to clean up the basement , but I was n't paying attention . I was just doing my job and I noticed something . <newline> <newline> I could hear muffled whispers in my head . I 'm at work for the first time in weeks , I 'm supposed to be working so I did n't have to go in so everyone else is . <newline> <newline> I hear footsteps from inside my home , I try to ignore it but it 's too late . My feet start to follow the footsteps to the basement , it ca n't be happening . I hear it again and this time I close my eyes . <newline> <newline> I feel someone grab my shoulder . I look down at my phone and I notice I have my heart rate shot up . I 'm sweating a lot . The light in my room light up as the light shines through my walls . The door clicks , there 's my wife . I grab the phone and hold it in my hand . <newline> <newline> *Hello ? * <newline> <newline> I feel a voice from behind me . 'What 's going on ?

The door starts to open but it ca n't . I try to push forward and pull myself closer to the phone . It 's there , it 's all there , it 's all over my phone . But I ca n't hear it . I keep moving . It wo n't fall . I 'm shaking . <newline> <newline> I hear the same door swing open again , a light shines thru it . I run for it . It 's there . I ca n't see it now . My vision starts to fade but I 'm sure it is me now . <newline> <newline> I open the house and
