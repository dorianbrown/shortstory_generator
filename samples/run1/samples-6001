[WP] Every time someone walks past on your car , you have the ability to change the time of their day by their gaze . Unfortunately , it 's already been a decade ( and no matter , it 's getting worse every day ) . <|startoftext|> <newline> I 've been stuck with it all these months , with the constant reminder of that constant reminder , `` I 'll see you in 2032 '' as well as these memories of the day . It 's only been 30 minutes . I can n't even think about the day I 'm going to die . I have n't been able to think about the people , the people , the events , anything for the past 40 minutes . Why did I get to remember all of those memories ? It 's only been about 5 minutes now , not a day . The sun is still shining as well . I want to stop thinking of time . There 's just nothing really important . For a few minutes , I have to focus on everything that 's nagging me . Every second . Every second . Every second . Now I 'm in my car . I can not make this stop . I do n't even know what to be hoping or worrying about . <newline> <newline> I pull out and look back to my car . It was n't even that I forgot about the car . My eyes went blank . I was in my seat . <newline> <newline> `` You 've only been here five minutes . I 've had a good run . Let 's see you in 2:00 ! '' the woman said with an excited look on her face and a hint of smugness . I was too afraid to even think about my life right now . There was something about that woman with that face I did n't know . I still do n't get what is happening to me , but I 've had enough of that to realize it . I need to tell myself that I need to stop thinking . No . I need to stop going around thinking about the people , the people , the events . <newline> <newline> `` No ! '' I screamed as the car suddenly stopped . I knew the woman was right . This was n't natural . The car was going to continue on for another three minutes , but I was afraid to think about what would happen if I stopped thinking immediately . I opened my eyes and looked up at the sky . A sea of stars . I 'd never been that excited for anything until , not since I was a kid . <newline> <newline> `` God I wish I could . '' I smiled , `` I need to do something for my dad when I get back ! '' <newline> <newline> I grabbed my coat and turned to walk away . I had to stop , I 've tried so many times . I just need to stop thinking . I do n't even have any reason to think . I just ca n't do it right now . I have n't been able to think about my dad , I was just too young , and too alone . I only thought about him , was n't there any better to start the day ? It just felt wrong . I have to think and I can not let everything come to be . I should n't have to think about them . I just want to know their story . I want to know what will happen if I did n't stop . I should n't have to kill another person . I should n't have to look at my dad in the mirror when he is just looking on . I have to stop thinking about them . I have to stop thinking about my dad . I am n't happy with things that could be a good day . I have to stop . I just want to end this . I 've given them the power to tell me that I need to stop . <|endoftext|>
[WP] You have the ability to create anything , by pressing keys and clicking on random objects . <|startoftext|> I wanted one thing : to create everything . <newline> <newline> It 's true that every time people say `` I want to create anything , '' it sounds so mean to say . I just do n't have the ability to do this . <newline> <newline> I just need to go out with it , create something . It 's so hard . <newline> <newline> I need a spark to go out . <newline> <newline> So , I go out to some random house on the side of town and it turns out my house is a pretty decent one . I take some candles and put them in the fire and everything goes good . <newline> <newline> There is a weird thing though . The candle I pulled came in the middle of the night , but all my candles were burnt .
