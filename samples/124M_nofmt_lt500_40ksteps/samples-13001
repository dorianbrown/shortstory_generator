 makes the humans a threat to the natural world instead of attacking them . <|startoftext|> "Hey guys... Sorry about how hard we are today. I feel like we have to move forward a bit. We can't be too long to do this, and it makes you realize how scared we are of you. We're not saying we don't love you. We're just tired of *you. *" <newline> <newline> The words came out a few hours later. "We've got to go, we've had too much time to think about the future! We need to get the humans back to the planet." <newline> <newline> The humans have been coming for us for centuries now. They've been destroying us for decades. The human's haven of space was built by them when we were not at war. They have done this only because they have been too blind to see the reality of the situation. If they had any hope in coming, why bother to get rid of me? I could've saved them all... <newline> I could've killed them all. <newline> I would have let them live on Earth. <newline> I would know that they would never come for me. I would know if they didn't want to die. I would have let them live. I would have killed those people, those *human*. Even if they wanted to live, I will do it. I will bring them back to Earth. I will make them happy. I will bring them back to their home, to their *home*. <newline> <newline> As he walked toward the gate, the humans began to glow green. <|endoftext|>
[WP] You 're on a date and it does n't go well . <|startoftext|> This is my first time submitting to writing prompts, so my feedback is appreciated <newline> <newline> > Your story is well done, for the most part. If it wasn't, I'm sure I wouldn't read it. But, there's enough potential in this response to make it worth your time. It's so, so good it could make you rethink your relationship with girls and what it feels like having kids would be. <newline> <newline> This is good for me. <newline> <newline> > I am so proud the response is well written and well thought out! Hope the person who gave you feedback will consider the feedback and do well. What you give them seems a lot better than they give to me! I found myself in a little bit of a rush to read what you have written for me before reading your post. <|endoftext|>
[WP] A man in prison meets a person in prison in a different setting . <|startoftext|> "Hey man, don't you think you can make good use of your cell?" <newline> <newline> John asked innocently. <newline> <newline> "Not with how long we've been there?" <newline> <newline> "I didn't sleep much, I think it was time... That was it." John sighed. <newline> <newline> "How many years later?" <newline> <newline> "In January..." John's thought slowed as he pondered whether to continue or continue to question the truth. <newline> <newline> "I told you... That's it. It was time to leave." <newline> <newline> What a terrible lie. How can he do that? The other inmates are so desperate to see him, especially after their first few years in prison. He could see them crying, crying at each other about being so lucky they have the resources to live through the next 2 years. He's a pretty decent man, I think. "I will" he always promises. <newline> <newline> "You're going to tell me the truth" John said. <newline> <newline> "I'll always let my man win." <|endoftext|>
[WP] You 're a surgeon . You take the scalpel and slice the patient open . Only problem is instead the scalpel was never meant to be used , and is instead a gift from God . Today you 're taking the scalpel to the operating table . <|startoftext|> *Oh, shit. * <newline> <newline> I look at my patient in shock. The surgical note is on page thirty of the sheet and next to it reads the word : "GOD" <newline> <newline> I roll the sheets into the operating table and grab my blade, taking aim. I cut the veins in a bit and begin to slowly slice the flesh out of the doctor's chest with a surgical blade. <newline> <new
