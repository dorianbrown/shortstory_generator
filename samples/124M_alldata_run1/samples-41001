 things at first . `` No way ! '' <newline> <newline> `` But ... But it works ! '' he gasped . `` So what do you mean no ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Well yeah , it could work . The idea came from one of the most powerful wizards I 'd ever seen . '' she said . `` But I was n't sure how to do it either . '' <newline> <newline> `` So you thought you could use the spell to have someone else take it ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Well ... .I ... '' he trailed off . <newline> <newline> `` So that meant I had to ... . '' his voice trailed away . <newline> <newline> `` Yeah ? '' she said . <newline> <newline> `` I was thinking about it again . Why should we go on with the procedure ? We have no idea how magic works . '' <|endoftext|>
[WP] You come across an old laptop computer . <|startoftext|> There she stood , leaning against a window , a gleaming disk on her lap . She was still with her eyes closed as the dust settled . <newline> <newline> I had been sitting here , on top of a cloud of dirt , in the dark of the night . She just sat there , looking out on the world , reading the ancient computer screen that hung in front of her . I was just glad to be out of her mind , it 's so peaceful , but I always got used to her presence . <newline> <newline> Today was the first day of my new job . Today was one of those days where you have to sit in the backseat and just sit there , watching life , just watching people take pictures and listen . What they were doing , what they had to say , it was nothing new , I was a college student , just waiting , waiting for a job . I had my eye on some old laptop that had just been found , so I decided that I would sit at the front desk , like most people do , I 'm not that kind of person . <newline> <newline> `` What do you think it looks like ? It used to be my phone - now it 's my laptop ! '' she said , pointing up , her hand still hovering above the keyboard . <newline> <newline> I looked up to her and I saw her face . I watched as she took some of the dust off of the computer and tossed it away into the bin in front of the screen , this time , the dust was getting old - like an old piece of dirt she looked more and more wrinkled and wrinkly , like that old piece of dirt she was sitting in . I glanced over and saw my wife , she was n't holding her phone , I saw my wife 's hand now , and I just sat there watching . I was n't really surprised as I thought about who to go to next . <newline> <newline> The window rolled up so I opened it and took a look . There she was , looking away from the computer , at the screen of her laptop , it was just a flat screen , and it was not the color of blue that my wife had brought home from the store , in fact it was n't blue at all , it was something green that she could n't put her finger on , or maybe it was . <newline> <newline> I smiled and told her that , what I had n't noticed was her hands , her hand still hovering over the keyboard , on the screen , had suddenly turned green as well , maybe red , like she used to do as a child , maybe to be able to see what was on there , but only it was n't blue I would guess as well . <newline> <newline> The screen went purple and my phone went down . But what I looked back up at her face , it was different , and I watched as the screen turned black . This time , a red glow came on just as I looked over me , it did not appear blue , that was something that looked like a black dot over the top of my phone . <newline> <newline> I looked down and found that I was walking around , but I was n't in the same spot I went to just now . My feet were n't going straight up anymore , my legs were on my back , but I knew that all this was the wrong thing to walk around . <newline> <newline> I began to walk , and her fingers had suddenly turned black . But I looked back , and she was n't looking back , she smiled , she seemed so happy , like she had n't seen me again for months and I had seen her smile a lot more . I was n't going to see her new phone again , and I did n
