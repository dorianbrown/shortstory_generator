 `` 'The only thing that 's keeping the others from finding it ' ' I swear . '' <newline> `` The Devil is gon na take the next one . '' <newline> `` He always 's a dick to be proud of , '' Mr. Cautier added , leaning forward to look into her eyes . `` His dick is too rough for humans , so you should 've seen something before . ' '' I smiled and left , leaving her alone in the basement . <|endoftext|>
[WP] How does a soldier overcome the fear of becoming immortal ? <|startoftext|> As my arm crumples , I feel something else - something very special in my presence . `` Sir , what was the matter ? '' I asked her . I was standing in front of a wall , watching everything go by . No matter where they were , what they were said , I was the only one who knew , with all due respect that she was n't the only one . As I watched the chaos break down on that fateful day , she smiled sadly , at the first sign of happiness - the smile that told everyone about the day when they were supposed to grow up but , as I watched the blood rushing from my wounds , I noticed her . `` ... '' I finally said after my pain faded . <|endoftext|>
[WP] After being rescued , you were given a `` ticket '' that you would be allowed to live and find and find yourself a new home in this city you had not seen before . <|startoftext|> We 've been walking from start to finish on the bus , all day long . We have come to a point where everyone knows we have no hope of moving on . We are here not because we are lost or confused . We are here because as our only hope in life , we try to make it through . I sit in the bus , sitting on the bench near the window of the bus , looking outside and trying to see what may be going through the eyes . I sit , staring at my legs . I think to myself , what shall I do next , and I realize I can not , because it must be the end . I feel as though I 'm running out of breath . Then , as I stop and pull from the window of the bus , I realise I ca n't move , I have hit the ground . It 's too dark out . The road is slippery now , and I 'm only able to get in the way now . The bus passes , and it must be the end . I step onto the platform , feeling that I am not safe in the darkness . It is too late to make it this far . I must turn around to make sure I do not come back out again . The darkness fills the road , I am alone . I try to stop myself , but as my hands are trembling I can sense I have got to make a break . A sudden sound catches my attention , and a voice calls out to me , `` HELP ! '' `` Is something wrong ? '' Tears fill my eyes , they can never be the same . I am alone . <|endoftext|>
[WP] You open the closet door to the same room multiple times , and when you get a response , nothing . <|startoftext|> I 've looked out the door once or twice and nothing . The first time the other was locked , and when it was open there was only a single one of the four doors that made it to my room . It 's a good deal , I think . We get a good deal if every time someone comes back it gets more expensive , but it only lasts until one of them is gone . I open a door when I 've found another one , three times . They 're pretty cheap if you know what I mean . I 've tried the only three , but nothing . I look down at my wrist watch , and as I do I see what I 've missed . That one looked for another five seconds . It just did n't have a button . <|endoftext|>
[WP] A boy from a very young age grows up with a gun . <|startoftext|> The gun <newline> <newline> The gun <newline> <newline> And it came from my grandmother . <newline> <newline> She was a gentle young woman , but when the time came to kill her , she could only stand up and say the words that would set you straight . My grandmother told me the other day about the time she was shot by a young child . It did n't make it more than a scream , but it 's the thing you can always hear . <newline> <newline> Her mother was a pretty old man . She was a pretty smart one too , but he ran away at the age she went . She got in the crosswalk while the kid was still in his car .
