 was in awe of the new man . <newline> <newline> *I think maybe if we were all born in different worlds , it would take an hour . * <newline> <newline> The man looked at his hand as if he was going to cry . The young man felt a tinge of dread in his heart until he thought of how terrible the world would be if the other people died . He then asked the young man what would happen if the other worlds did not cooperate with Earth . <newline> <newline> *Well , I suppose they never had time to invent a nuclear weapon , or , well , I have seen enough of the world and I could n't say which would be better . Not if they were so powerful , they could easily kill a human . * <newline> <newline> The young man looked at the old man for a while . `` I suppose we could get rid of them . '' The young man shook his head . `` I thought there would be something better for us to do when Earth was n't as big as it is now . '' <newline> <newline> He then asked the old man if he had noticed that there were n't any other worlds that had n't received nuclear weapons , and the old man nodded his head . <|endoftext|>
[WP] You have the ability to reverse time . To use this you must first must choose between sacrificing your life for the greater good or your life for the greater evil . This can be done by either killing yourself , or by a pattern recognition test . <|startoftext|> They call me *The Riddler* , but not just any of them . I 'm sure you 're used to the concept . <newline> <newline> Well , I 've seen so many terrible things . I 'd be out of this damned town at any moment , so no one would even notice me , and I could live my life normally . <newline> <newline> Now , as I 'm walking my route , I see a truck approaching . It 's too late , I 'm on the sidewalk , but it 's too late . I hear a `` Oh ! '' from the driver . He 's always known what I was capable of . I 've had this ability since I was a boy , but I never did see , nor did anyone else as the other drivers pulled away , their car full of curiosity as the truck struck a house . No one noticed . Nobody knew about it either . I just wanted to be like you . <newline> <newline> Of course I was . Everyone knows that . That 's why I was in this accident . I was afraid as I realized what I 'd done , it was a perfect excuse . Of course , no one knows about the curse that would come when I get caught . No one I knew had known of it . That 's the curse , it 's the curse of time . <newline> <newline> I was in a car , and I 'm going back . The truck hits the car behind me , I 'm out of sight . There is no one but me , and no one I know who . I 'm walking this way , and there 's no one here , but it all is so obvious . This is the gift I have , I know that if I 'm ever to live under time well . My mind , my life . <newline> <newline> I need to get out of here , I just want to meet you . I have no control over myself , I ca n't . But now that I 'm not going to meet any closer to you , well , now I 'm ready to see you in a life I have not lived before . <newline> <newline> This is a gift that I did not wish for , but I did . I will be the greatest villain in the world if I am a complete failure in the Riddler 's test . <newline> <newline> Goodbye , <newline> <newline> <|endoftext|>
[WP] As a reward for your loyalty , you are given the ability to play the most altruistic and most kind games of your life when you are 12 years old . Tell your story in the form of a detailed test in which you are the evil child who is beaten in games of your choice . <|startoftext|> It started with the games . <newline> <newline> I was 14 ; a cute girl , with red hair and a scar running down my face . Her parents beat me . I did n't want to , and they wanted her to die . I do n't remember why . Maybe it was because they had kids ; maybe because there was nothing I could do to stop it . <newline> <newline> I played the game , after all
