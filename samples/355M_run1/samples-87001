 . <newline> <newline> The world was never the same , not since my death . In the early days of my reign I would often come to my kingdom , and I would tell the people of my kingdom about the evils that had plagued them . <newline> <newline> People were at first skeptical , but I did my best to convince them that I was the one of peace . I told them it was a tale I heard from my father . I gave them a simple message , `` Life for what it is ! '' But the people did n't listen , and I did n't give them the details . My kingdom was crumbling around them , and I could see the loss in their eyes . I was the one who had to fix the country so I could prosper . <newline> <newline> And with the death of the queen I retired in my tower , and with this new life I set out to fix the nation as best as I could . I saw the people of my land as weaklings , and gave them strength on their quest for prosperity . I told them I would fight for them and fight to build up their kingdoms . They were weaklings , and in all the years I had led them on their quest to become something of a strong kingdom , and I gave them the most beautiful princess in the land . <newline> <newline> The princess was beautiful , with golden hair , and she had a soft voice , which filled my kingdom with joy . I would sit on the throne and tell her stories of dragons , magic , and knights . I told her about my many experiences in war , and how I could always manage a victory with a simple speech . To her , my people were savages who needed to be put down . I gave them my wisdom , and my magic . Even after all these years , she still listened to me , and she could never stop saying `` yes , yes '' in return . The first time I had spoken to her , she nearly burst into tears . I told her to keep her princess safe until I had returned . I told her I was willing to die for her , even if it meant enslaving all of her people . <newline> <newline> Her screams now filled mine . It was now she ran to me . She demanded I make her kingdom great again , and I promised to do it . I took what I could . The peasants were too weak , and too poor . Their leader had told me I needed to do this , for the people of the land who had lost everything . I promised to give the land back what it had . I promised they would be given better living conditions , but I would create a strong empire . They needed me , and I could not make that happen . How could I ? I was weak , and could not do this . I was trapped . So I would die , and if I lived , we would die together . It would be the greatest victory our kingdom has ever experienced , and for the people of the earth to see this would be something I could only wish for . <newline> <newline> But that is not why I am writing this , is it Mr ? ? Do you have any questions ? <newline> <newline> Mr. President <newline> <newline> <|endoftext|>
[WP] In the future , cloning is an illegal thing . The closest clone clinic is a secret underground facility with a single clone supervisor . This is n't the only clone supervisor : there are dozens of supervisors who work in every location . The supervisor gets assigned randomly . <|startoftext|> I never would have guessed a person could fit up the shirt so tight . She wore a loose sleeved suit , with a pale skin tone . That was the most odd part of her look , as it was clear that her skin was a result of months of hard work . <newline> <newline> I have n't written a lot of things ever since that day . I 've got my head in the clouds , and I guess I can write a piece of one of my novels . If I do n't succeed then I do n't have the energy for it . This will be my first story , but I ca n't wait for the next . <|endoftext|>
[WP] When you look in the mirror , the reflection sees you . <|startoftext|> There , facing away from me , I looked in awe . The mirror reflected not upon my face , more upon my own . It stared into me , as if I was watching my own reflection . A cold , clear gaze . <newline> <newline> The world shifted , changing , the world shook , shifting , the world 's landscape spun as I turned around . There in that place , in that mirror , was the answer I seeked , the one I seeked , I seeked out for . I was everywhere , I know , but none of
