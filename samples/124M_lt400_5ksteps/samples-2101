His hair is grey and he is the only one with any sense of color . He 's still the only person with any sense of color , however it 's clear that he 's lost something in doing that , because nothing can escape a human being that has died , and therefore that 's why he feels nothing is left . <newline> <newline> **After many years and countless nights of trying to be a deity while a being lived still but that is eventually realized . <newline> <newline> He is the sole living being left to die ... <|endoftext|>
[WP] Write an origin story for someone you really do n't know . Or maybe one that you do . <|startoftext|> I was once a child , my mother and father were the same age and when I was born as a child , my father died . I grew up in the same house , only I grew up in a different house . My father never left except for a year and a half of my first year , the whole family moved down the road and he moved back down the road . I do n't know why I left , as I always wanted something and when I was in my fourth year , things were different , I had seen all those things , I was older and everything . My sister was my only daughter , who was not a person . I miss her . <|endoftext|>
[WP] Your child is a serial killer . They 're all you have now . Tell him you saved a few with your last words . <|startoftext|> What has been the strangest thing I 've seen in years is the child in my mind . His clothes are still all ripped in . He 's always been an artist , like anyone else . I mean , he 's just a little bit of a genius . He just ... it does n't make any sense . It just seems like there 're so many things I should have . He just seemed so ... bored out there ? I thought to myself `` Why ? ! ! '' as I walked outside to my parents room , they said `` I just found out he 's a serial killer ! '' <newline> <newline> So , as it turns out , he is a serial killer . <newline> <newline> I told him this was some sort of joke , but what I did not remember , was what I was thinking . I felt so small by his actions and even more tiny by my sense of smell . I looked over and I was able to recognize it , only to find a few small pieces of fabric in my hands . My fingers were numb from the shock of his fingers being soaked in perspiration , that was all I remembered . My only regret is that I could n't do anything else . I look up now , with tears in my eyes , and I look up at the window , wondering if I saw him that day ! What am I supposed to do ? <|endoftext|>
[WP] Every few years there are a series of events from your life that start to affect how you live . A child begins to grow up , learns to love other people , and dies , one by one . <|startoftext|> I am not your father , and I never meant to . I always intended to make you father me , and in doing so I was wrong . I will never truly understand why I did this , and you will never understand why I did it . <newline> <newline> The only reason I ever tried to stop you or let you know is because I thought you were special to me . You were *always* loved , but I never thought that I would love any of you . <newline> <newline> You are one of my most beloved friends , and I never expected you to become yours , until you walked away from me . Until you made me feel like I would n't be worth the time . Until you stole my
