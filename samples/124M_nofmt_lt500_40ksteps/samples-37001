 what did he do? He never did. The only one of the two who managed to help him was a man named Jim. It was so strange, though. Jim was a young boy himself, and he was in no way able to handle the responsibility. So, Jim just went on his merry way. <newline> <newline> When my father was about six months back, the old man was walking his dog in a dark alley, no longer able to read the sign language he was given. So, I asked him what was he talking about. <newline> <newline> Apparently, it was only a matter of some sort of prank. The old man, who had been talking to himself for days before he was to give up on the question, had gone through a series of "shady days '" and ended up here, again. This time though, he hadn't been trying to break into the family property. <newline> <newline> It turns out, Jim was actually quite a nice guy- <newline> <newline> And so he was arrested, and for a day and a half before the police did arrest him, Jim was never heard from again. I guess it's all a big joke to keep people out of a man's life. <|endoftext|>
[WP] The protagonist is terminally ill with a terminal disease that would kill them all . He travels to the doctor to receive his final prescription to kill all of them and give their lives for it . <|startoftext|> My mind was in an endless cycle. My heart's pounding every time I thought about my son. Every minute spent in the hospital with mom. Every second spent waiting for dad to come home to us. Finally my mind drifted to my wife. <newline> <newline> "I need a vacation," she said. <newline> <newline> "I want you to," I said. <newline> <newline> My vision faded as I reached my hand to her mouth. The tears were falling to her skin. My eyes were shut. <newline> <newline> As we walked past the office, a thought popped into my head. My doctor. His voice said something to me. <newline> <newline> "I need vacation," he said. <newline> <newline> I didn't respond. <newline> <newline> "What?" <newline> <newline> "I need you to take a vacation before you get sick. I need you to do something to bring the world the love it needs." <newline> <newline> "Like what? What do you want to do? You're the only one, my dear? Why'd I have to kill all of you to just come back to the hospital?" <newline> <newline> "Well, I've known that many of you have gone into the pain. This was your wish, to end it all," I said. It was not meant to end for me. <newline> <newline> "What you want to do? Stop the pain? You just have to think about it yourself," he said firmly. <newline> <newline> "You think I'm crazy? Why do things like that? I'm the reason why. You're the reason why," my wife said. <newline> <newline> "So if you don't want that, you're the reason I will take you to your plane. I can't die before the cancer leaves us." My wife said. <newline> <newline> "That's a story," he said. The sun's rays were shining through my window. "That's a story about me." <newline> <newline> -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - <newline> <newline> Hey, guys, let's go for a walk! <|endoftext|>
[WP] You 've been kidnapped and are the lead scientist into a room containing the greatest interrogations ever done . <|startoftext|> "There you go!" She looked at me from side to side as if I was a child. <newline> <newline> "Uh-huh," I said, "you know where your cell is." I picked up the cell and walked down the side towards the interrogation cell. It was a small white space, probably a room of one kind or another. I moved a plexy. <newline> <newline> "What I'm looking for is an answer to any of your questions, Sir!" <newline> <newline> "You want to know the answer to anything? You're a prisoner!" I pulled a pen from the sleeve of her pants, and started writing. <newline> <newline> "How do I do it
