 in a car chase in a suburb of Los Angeles , California , and the vehicle that caused his death . <|startoftext|> `` I think you should buy your own plane ticket out of the box . '' <newline> <newline> `` This is n't the same . Where is the money ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Your cousin 's here . I need your tickets . '' <newline> <newline> My uncle shook his head , but he took his coat and a large bag out of the closet , and shoved it onto his shoulder and into my uncle 's hand . <newline> <newline> `` Take him to the plane . '' <newline> <newline> `` No you can , I have the money . '' <newline> <newline> I was relieved . This is what I could have . He 'd be dead in front of me . <newline> <newline> My uncle stepped off the motorcycle into a line of cars with my uncle . We took off . Suddenly the lights were on and a man took us from the alley . My uncle 's face was scarred . Some of it made him look like he 'd been mugged . <newline> <newline> `` Welcome to the club ! We 're all free men and women ! '' <newline> <newline> My uncle looked like he was in pain . <newline> <newline> `` Get dressed and get down from this seat ! We 're gon na go to the club , drink , relax , or have some fun ! '' <newline> <newline> I put my coat and pants down on the chair next to me . <newline> <newline> `` Come on . '' <newline> <newline> My uncle said . <newline> <newline> `` Go ahead . '' <newline> <newline> My uncle got up and followed my cousin . My Uncle went first . He walked into a pub , and I followed him . In the end there were no signs of the club being there , but the sounds of people drinking and talking , I could hear a lot of people and they talked . A group of guys walked in . In the second hand-to-hand combat room . Next on the list was a tall , bald man . When you put in those words and imagine being a bald dude , you can not help but walk at the edge of that chair when you look around and try to keep walking , and it is n't the kind of person you like to make the person he 's leaning on look . <newline> <newline> I stopped what I was doing here and sat at the bar , looking at the rest of Los Angeles . <newline> <newline> `` They said we 'd be here soon .

[ IP ] The Night Sky <|startoftext|> The moon was full , with stars blazing . My sister was going through puberty and I did the same as well . My brother was starting to get more and more distant , and did n't know he even knew the word friendship was . I knew all about the night sky , all the great and the terrible . <newline> <newline> We 'd been sitting here , watching the stars so long , and still we did n't know what color it was . It 's like we did n't know what there were . I just did n't see it . <newline> <newline> My sister sat on the lap of my arm , her little toes were all the color in the sky . She could n't even hold herself with her hand anymore . She had the face of a newborn , bright suns flashing in her eyes . <newline> <newline> My brother sat opposite me , staring at where I was . He looked like the man I 'd known for many years . Tall and built like a tree , but still with a sparkle of youth under his head . I knew him when he was a small one , but I did nothing , so that the world would be the same . <newline> <newline> My sister reached for me and let go of the blanket over her shoulder , and just looked at me . My brother looked like he was old enough to be our dog . He looked exhausted , but I ignored him . <newline> <newline> We watched the stars as well , as the sun went down over the forest . My sister had taken her bedsheets off and rolled under the blankets that she was carrying just to get out of the bedroom , but then she got up and headed for the door . <newline> <newline> `` Come on , '' I said , `` I 'd appreciate it if it was still daylight outside the house .
