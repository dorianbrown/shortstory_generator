======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 I want my job back . Why ? <|startoftext|> You see my job... <newline> No, that's not how it works. <newline> I get paid for the time you spend, because I don't have to work hard for days. I can work at my own firm for hours - the good-boys always like to say they're good at work though, but for some reason I'm not really good at it. What, do they believe that? <newline> You say there's nothing that good about working? <newline> I guess. Sure you can help people. I think you're right, but the people you help are never really good at what they are doing. For a long time it was just me with my hands busy, while they went about their business, but they never really appreciated the work I did on them. So now I work harder and more, more and more. <newline> Why, you ask? Because no work is ever good. The work that they do, the work that we did on them, they are never good. I was doing good work and they didn't have the guts to help me through the day. They just want to be happy! <newline> Well, I suppose you're right. As long as I'm not dead, then they'd get to keep it all. <newline> It doesn't really matter now, do you know what I mean? <|endoftext|>
[WP] I hope this is helpful . <|startoftext|> When the news stories started, I usually thought it would go over well. Everyone got the good news - we survived the explosion but the people that survived died horribly quickly. A lot of the survivors made peace with it all, even though they didn't see the whole truth. They just didn't understand that they'd been on a literal bomb with no one left alive, no one to blame but us. <newline> <newline> When the news stopped coming, though we all did that one thing that was so hard to do, that we couldn't do it anymore, that the people where safe, and we only had to look out for the people who died but never died. That's really selfish of me. And maybe that's why my mom misses me now. Because who's taking the time to spend time with somebody who's died before, who's just missed the family day? <newline> <newline> Well, you see, here's where the idea got stupid. This whole "bomb and fire" thing, and that was that one. It didn't sound very smart to me, and it sounds kind of like they did something stupid. Hell, we're in the middle of a nuclear strike, and people die. And I have no idea what kind of nuclear strike was going on at the time. What the hell kind of nuclear strike is this? And then another explosion and everyone gets to get on with it? I'd know if they kept their heads up over the ruins. Like a joke, a stupid prank. <newline> <newline> So we started the idea, and soon people started living in bunkers because they couldn't walk without their legs, and I'm okay with this. I suppose I couldn't say the same because I'm already sitting here, but the bomb was just too far-fetched for my head. <newline> <newline> I guess I'll just take your side on this, then. Good job. I guess that's a good way to start the day. <newline> <newline> <|endoftext|>
[WP] You die and go to Heaven , only to find there 's a waiting queue inside.. <|startoftext|> When I came to the light I felt an overwhelming sadness that wasn't present before. It was like someone was waiting in the shadows. It wasn't an odd thought that you'll have noticed before since it isn't exactly as boring to a normal person, but to find the answer, to find someone waiting in this room that you haven't heard of. <newline> <newline> I opened my eyes expecting to see a familiar face before I started to panic. A small mirror where I'd seen before. It was still very new, and had the slightest curve of wrinkles across my forehead which seemed to be from the heat of the room and how I looked down. In one hand was a briefcase with something in it, a large black rectangle shaped like the shape of a coin with a note beside it. I didn't know what it was or what it was to such a strange person that they didn't seem to notice. <newline> <newline> "Hello, welcome to Hell, welcome to Purgatory," the light said, almost seeming to whisper its words out. But I didn't recognize it. I didn't know who I was before I even spoke
