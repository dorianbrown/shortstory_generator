[WP] Describe the thoughts of a ( non ) sentient being who 's loved/loved by at least multiple people . <|startoftext|> He was a sad little thing . <newline> <newline> He was the most annoying kid I 've ever met . He was n't smart as a turtle ( his shell is really weird ) so we did n't see him often and he would have to be called a puke in front of every dog and cat . I wonder why he would even bother calling me Puke for a dog , I always liked his fur . A couple years ago , we found him at the park ... `` Mr. Johnson '' I called him . He would tell me to get to somewhere , anyone , we needed him . He was n't tall or slim or ugly , he just did odd things . You 'd just learn a year later that he had a hard time walking around . When the police found him , and started talking with the local dogs about me - oh , God , I 'm so sorry . We were like what they call dogs and I 'll always be called Puke because you just never give me your fur ! I hate you and I hate your tears . He 'll never understand why you would hate me . I miss my best friend but I love you ! Just tell me that you 're sorry , I 'll always love you , I love you Puke , please , please just be happy that you know that you do n't have to do this ! Just , please be happy . I love you and I hate you ! <|endoftext|>
[WP] A man has the power to bestow a very special gift upon someone . Anyone that dies , gains the ability to bestow their gift to another person . <|startoftext|> The young girl could have easily told her that he was a gift , a curse . All the children were gift-givers , but the one that had been bestowed had died years ago . She 'd been young enough to learn about the powers and curse , but did n't have the courage to test it . <newline> <newline> As if she could just call him a boy her age . He would n't have had the energy of that boy any other day . So she would not be sure . <newline> <newline> She 'd had the ability to choose one gift to give , but there was a curse , a horrible fate that some of were very lucky to live . <newline> <newline> She 'd already had her first gift , her ability to choose a gift for everyone she was destined to love . That was the gift she 'd known . That was her gift of love . The one that would get her in love . <newline> <newline> She 'd chosen her first gift . She 'd told herself it would be the gift of the most fortunate . She 'd chosen her second gift . The gift to make sure she was the happiest boy she would ever be . The moment of truth she 'd known . <newline> <newline> She had her first and only gift . A gift she thought was her gift of good fortune . <newline> <newline> One of many gifts they 'd given her . <newline> <newline> `` Do n't try to cheat . This gift is yours . I just wanted you to be happy and free , you know . '' `` Come on '' she said . She knew that was the only gift that meant happiness , and she 'd decided it would be the gift of an almost perfect relationship . <newline> <newline> As she watched him smile and his arms wrap around her and hold her close , she could tell there was a terrible feeling , in the inside of her . She had never felt so completely at ease in her life , and this was the first time anyone had done that . <newline> <newline> He was right . The power was evil . This gift was evil . His love could drive those girls insane . She could not change that . <newline> <newline> She 'd picked a gift of evil before , and she 'd picked this . She 'd chosen her second gift , and she 'd picked something very evil , probably not even worth a second thought . <newline> <newline> She decided to make the decision to get rid of him . She 'd killed him that day . She 'd been going to school the same day and she knew she 'd need those grades for that . <newline> <newline> Her power of choice . The power that could make the evil of evil fall into the evil that could now be defined . <newline> <newline> Her power of Choice . <|endoftext|>
