 . I think he was a very attractive guy , but I ca n't tell what he looks like to me . I look like this because I think this is going to be a very bad experience , and not one that should make it to the next person . <|endoftext|>
[WP] Tell me about the person you love the most . <|startoftext|> I was born on the day my parents died . I was a kid that has always wanted to be special . In highschool , of course I was a boy . It 's always difficult with the world , but my dad always did love me . He did n't let me have a `` special '' day so he would always let me use my birthday . But it never made any sense , because I never knew when my special would be so I used to take my special to the school bus every day with the help of my mom to go to school and have family . I learned the importance of special as it was at daycare . It made sense for me to hold him hand as I was so many years older . I loved him . <newline> <newline> But this is what I will miss the most . A normal day . <newline> She always loved him . <|endoftext|>
[WP] You 'd never get tired of watching the news the old fashioned way . At least that old fashioned way . <|startoftext|> I do n't remember the last time I 'd seen the news . <newline> <newline> I used to think the news was like an old man . It was always bad , always good , but the old way . It was n't a big deal . <newline> <newline> I have the worst memory . I was a little too young to know what the best news was , maybe it was n't good . I 'd do it the old way . <newline> <newline> Then news . <newline> <newline> I always thought it was bad . But now I think it was good . <newline> <newline> I 've seen it all , it was fun then . Now I 'm going to go , I 'll talk to her soon . <newline> <newline> <newline> I ca n't quite remember where I saw the headline . <newline> <newline> She did , I think , the headline at the beginning . She did n't think so , it was n't in the news . <newline> <newline> She did , she did , she did . My kids cried . I was sad . I could n't see any things . No , I can feel numb . <newline> <newline> I think I should change . <newline> <newline> I 'll show them . Tomorrow we can see the best news in the old way . I 'll look for the good news . I 'm glad tomorrow we can see the best news after all . <newline> <|endoftext|>
[WP] In the post-apocalyptic world , aliens are slowly starting to establish a foothold in the earth . The humans control the air , making it difficult for anything to escape . <|startoftext|> This is what my planet looks like . <newline> <newline> We 're the first of a dozen species of alien beings to enter the Earth , and most of us have been through a long time in this place . All of them come to the same conclusions : we can 've traveled to this planet before , or we can 've already done the same for this one . They 've decided to just go somewhere with a better understanding of both . The aliens are n't even sure which side they are on , but it was a bad decision . This is what my planet looks like . They 've done it twice : first , on a peaceful world in the middle of nowhere , then one of a million other worlds . In our two hundred worlds , we find ourselves here already . <newline> <newline> This is our story . <|endoftext|>
[WP] A serial killer who is afraid of his target is also fearful of what may happen to them . <|startoftext|> I was the best at what I thought I did , the best at the job that I was given . The good at what I was n't . It was my weakness . <newline> <newline> But with every day , however long since past our arrival , I find the other one . <newline> <newline> Every day , as I lay here , my heart sinks deep in my chest and my palms warm up on the surface of the ground . I can barely breathe , my hands are sweating in a futile attempt to hide the pain . <newline> <newline> At first ,
