 I want you to know that this is as good as you and he is mine . You need to learn what your doing and do n't get upset about it , but he really does n't know that . '' <newline> <newline> `` We 'll go for a run ! '' I say . After we start the run , my phone rings . <newline> *phone is the last thing I remember , but I can feel the voice on the other end . It should n't be too long ... * <newline> *I 've got to get to work before the car 's going to leave ! * <newline> `` What ? I told you ! '' <newline> *I ca n't even remember my name ! * <newline> `` It 's time for a walk , sir , '' says the driver . I give him a small sigh . I am a taxi driver .

One foot behind . And at that very moment , a bus is coming . <newline> My phone rings again . <newline> *I knew it ! The driver looks at me . His face is as blank as the rest of the drivers ' faces , and as a little smug , he starts to get up . * <newline> <newline> `` How is the bus still here ? '' I ask . I hear a woman 's voice behind me . <newline> `` Just be careful ! They 're approaching right now ! '' <newline> `` Oh no , I knew there was an accident with the driver ! '' <newline> <newline> `` Get him out of the way ! '' <newline> <newline> I am out of the city . There is no turning back . But a bus , this man , that bus , stops before I can help . <newline> *God damn it ... * <|endoftext|>
