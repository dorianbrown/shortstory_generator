[WP] During a lunar eclpise, suddenly the moon splits into two pieces and the world falls into chaos . <|startoftext|> That wind whistled again as I looked across the night sky . It was a cold night out , and you would expect snow falling down over this vast expanse of snow . The moon illuminated a faint point from the darkness that slowly drifted across the horizon . It was shaking the earth around it , and the wind was sending smaller pieces of moon into great pieces . <newline> <newline> What was I doing ? <newline> <newline> I readied myself for the worst possible situation I could imagine . I had been taught what would happen if the moon split them down into two separate moon halves . My good friend David had told me about the science behind it , and how the moon splits up into pieces and the pieces come together . <newline> <newline> `` You have to make your way through the ice at the very edge of the moon for yourself . '' <newline> <newline> Another cold night out , something terrible was going to happen . <newline> <newline> I got up out of bed and pushed myself out of the bed . On the other side of the room is my old bed by which I had lay in for seven years . The other side was dark . I donned my dress shirt and got ready for the journey I would make . <newline> <newline> For a few hours , my head was filled by crashing through the ice , feeling the weight of it all . I could n't think about anything else for those few hours . <newline> <newline> The wind whistled once more . <newline> <newline> `` I 'm starting to get worried . Everyone is walking around , with out one- '' <newline> <newline> I froze . <newline> <newline> `` Each night I get this little bit of moon onto the floor , and then I can see the moon . It 's wrong . '' <newline> <newline> Oh god . <newline> <newline> `` Some people from all over the world are going to be waking up . '' <newline> <newline> I could hear someone calling me to the room . David said something about how they are going to be waking up , but I did n't care about it . I only knew about something I thought they would do once they get me back . <newline> <newline> I walked out of the room with my head in my hands . I slowly made my way over to the window and watched . I could see two pieces of moon falling towards the Earth . Except one of the pieces was resculpted and floating before the moon . Normally it would fall , but the moon was not resculpted . <newline> <newline> I pushed against my wall and let myself in . I had a panic attack attack and my legs were slipping . I threw myself onto the ledge . I began to whine and scream to get to the other side . <newline> <newline> I could hear footsteps on the ground . Whatever I think it was crept up the stairs , coming towards me . I could see it was the man I met 21 years ago . He looked scared . This was the six year anniversary . <newline> <newline> I could hear gasps and screams . I looked up to see them before I saw the moon . A silver-gloon that looked like ice , I shouted . <newline> <newline> `` Somebody leave ! '' <newline> <newline> They did n't notice a man rush past me . I watched intently as the moon landed and then , boom , the moon was gone . <newline> <newline> I looked down at my body . In my last moment before passing out , I could make out one of David 's words from near the window . <newline> <newline> `` Dad ! We found the moon ! ''
