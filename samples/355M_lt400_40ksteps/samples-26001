 , I 've had some bad days but this was an endearing one as I 'm sure I 'm in touch with the other girls . <newline> <newline> All I can look at is them as they stare at me . All staring , in unison , each looking for the next opportunity to strike . They have a good look at me and I 'm impressed . <newline> <newline> One of them catches my eye and asks `` where is everyone ? '' <newline> <newline> `` A new boy . You want to go dance with him ? '' <newline> <newline> I look at the girl behind him and try to smile . It 's hard , trying to fit in with the newbie . <newline> <newline> `` I would do that , but the man behind the glass says that she wants to be with him . So he asks her out before the glass shuts . '' <newline> <newline> I nod my head in reply , but the girl behind the glass looks at me with a look that tells me she 's in love . <|endoftext|>
[WP] You are the one true prophet of apocalypse . Everyone else can only bring a little bit of this apocalypse to them , it does n't make sense . <|startoftext|> I had just gotten in to the White House in hopes of a meeting with Vice President , when it all go blacked out . <newline> <newline> When I woke up on the Whitehouse computer screen , I was filled with the horror that I had just experienced . <newline> <newline> It was like being transported into an alien hell . I tried to get a feeling of panic , but nothing could open up in my heart . In my dreams , everything that my heart felt or thought had a blacked out . I could n't move anything . But I knew where I was . I was looking at the computer . I had n't had any of the problems that have plagued other people . All they had was nothing . <newline> <newline> I opened the browser and there were no more links , instead I was filled with the dread that I knew would n't come to fruition . <newline> <newline> Every moment , from just the web , was a single paragraph . On the computer , I could only scroll through . What was I talking about ... <newline> <newline> I looked to the screen and it was a picture . The picture of the President , smiling with the people from the future . <newline> <newline> I looked behind myself and there was a person holding a microphone . He was speaking . <newline> <newline> `` Hey there , guys . It 's time to say 'hello ' to everyone that you know . The world 's going to end tomorrow . We can save all of you , right ? You 'll see . I just hope you 'll all be ready , cause the world does n't make good news . '' <|endoftext|>
[WP] A single person in the world wakes up on a bright , fluorescent day and they see three words : `` We Need to Talk '' <|startoftext|> The man was on the floor , his arms and legs caked and rivalled to the carpet . In an instant , everything was pitch black ; the man , his face contorted in a thousand degree of pain . <newline> <newline> What was happening to him , you might ask ? <newline> <newline> That is n't how we see him ... at least , to us . It was n't how I saw myself . I woke up with a shock this morning , a shock of an unseen force . <newline> <newline> `` We need to talk to you and ... '' <newline> <newline> His words were not empty . We saw him make a noise , a noise about the whole world . We heard a sound not of words but of a click . <newline> <newline> His mouth moved in a way to make the conversation clear . <newline> <newline> `` You are the only man who needs to help the world . I have taken you as my host . No one , I mean no one , is offering any kind of help . '' <newline> <newline> A smile grew upon his face . <newline> <newline> `` You may call me Satan , I have the best advice . If you want something from me , I will give you something . '' <newline> <newline> He grinned . He did n't see the dark shadows or the piercing sounds of a gun . <newline> <newline> I felt sick . I do n't really want to die anymore . <|endoftext|>
