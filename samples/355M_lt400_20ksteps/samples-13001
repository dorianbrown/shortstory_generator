 glance a hole of light in the sky , and we begin to make contact . The alien vessel has no reply . A voice emanates from the alien ship , and the alien race responds : <newline> <newline> Hello my children . Our people have grown in stature and we have made war on your world but this new race and I , we are your rulers now . We have fought for your world . You are the last human of your species , the one on your planet . <newline> <newline> With our lives on the line , your species is being exterminated . We come out for you . This message was sent by the last race on your planet . You shall not last . You shall not live . You shall die . <|endoftext|>
[WP] The hero is dead , the princess is gone , the king is gone , and there was a curse . Write about the fall of the kingdom , as we see it . <|startoftext|> My head exploded just a little while after I went through with the plan . It was n't as planned as I had made it . My father had told me , he was n't a good ruler , but he was a good king , and that was n't true . He 's an assassin , and that assassin was the greatest assassin the world had ever known , and our queen had killed every single assassin she could find , including mine . I tried telling my father that he would not be able to kill her , but he laughed at me and refused to listen to me . I knew then that I had to go through with it , and I would die for my father 's sake . That assassin knew I was the one true heir of the throne , and I only had one last chance to end it all . Only a king could truly kill the queen before everyone else had . Only a king could end a curse , and he himself was bound to die for his father 's sins . Only a one . Only a one . That was that . I smiled , and I fell to my knees , and I died for my father 's sins . <|endoftext|>
[WP] You are in the bathroom of a nice hotel room when you hear a familiar knocking at the bathroom . It 's your brother , asking why you 're late to the game . <|startoftext|> `` Dude . Come on . You 've been late for the whole game . '' He knocked again on the stall . I looked up and saw the man standing above me , looking down on me with a heavy frown on his lips . <newline> `` Sorry . '' I responded . <newline> `` Listen here . I- '' <newline> `` No ! '' He grabbed the stall door to open it , and then knocked again . I had to look past him and hear him speak again . <newline> `` I 'll be in your face '' . I tried to get up but he was already pulling me down . `` You 've been in my stall ever since I finished up my game and I 'm not letting you go on . No ! '' He started punching me once , and then three times . I managed to pull away from him because I could see him just throwing his punches at me like it was a toy . <newline> I fell to my knees and looked down at him with an angry smile , I was n't sure if he would stop now or not , but it was too late for me to know just what he was saying . He punched me once more in the face and then started swinging his fists on me . I did n't know what I would do if he hit me , but I did do it anyways . The two of us just kept swinging . <newline> My brother tried to fight me off from behind , but he was on the front foot now . He was a bit late , so I landed punches on his head , but I did n't get the advantage , but there was something weird about his attack . He kept throwing punches , but he threw them so fast they had almost been a blur , and then he started to move in a straight line . He had never used this move in his whole life , and I guess he was too arrogant to do it himself . <newline> After a moment , the man in the gray cloak came forward . His right shoulder was pointing above the waist , like a giant black spider with a claw . `` You 're not my brother , asshole , you 're my brother ! '' He shouted , to the ground . Then he looked up and saw me standing there , the man was starting to leave the bathroom . He yelled , `` What the hell is happening ? '' He then threw a punch at me , and the ground began to shake , and the wall began to crumble . My brother and then I had been sent flying out the window and into the street below . I was a lucky bastard that landed perfectly for the wall .
