 on. <newline> <newline> We all waited, for the day that the moon would change into a star. <newline> <newline> We prayed for the Moon to fall from the sky and land on the sun at the same time. <newline> <newline> We waited until the day passed. <newline> <newline> We went back to the light. <newline> <newline> The Moon slowly began to rise with every passing second. <newline> <newline> It was strange then that after hundreds of years, life became so commonplace, it was almost like we were still doing the same thing. <newline> <newline> It was a beautiful day. <|endoftext|>
[WP] A young child mistakenly believes that his crush is a cyborg by his former life in a body store for android living robots . <|startoftext|> She's beautiful... Not ugly. Her hair looks good, but when she makes noises, it's much more like the music playing on its own. She has a nice personality and is well cared for, her hair looks good because of it, but she doesn't have that personality like a cyborg that could cause harm. Her body has a very low vibration which helps her move away from other objects in the store, because people don't realize what the vibration is. She wears glasses. No, glasses, though. She's only wearing glasses because she's not really wearing them anymore and that's why I know. <newline> <newline> I have this one weakness. <newline> <newline> She's a pretty little thing, about 7 or 8 years old! She has these small breasts and curves which make her look like a girl. She's not really the most attractive girl you see when you're alone in the store, because she's not really any different than you. She's a bit of a loser, though, she's the type that never goes out shopping, and always wears dress pants and jeans or something, and she's just that annoying and annoying because she's too nice! <newline> <newline> I try my best to talk her into buying new clothes, but she doesn't give me a choice. At first I just pretend -- I'm more interested in her than anything else. Then she has sex out of some sort of metal box or robot toy... That isn't her thing at all... I try and convince her that I'm serious. She doesn't listen, but at the same instance, I think she's about to make more noises, but she doesn't know what the noise is, but it's all so quiet. Well, that's beside the point. <newline> <newline> She's a girl who can't talk, and I understand it. I want her to talk out loud, no matter how many times I try. <newline> <newline> One day, I decided to try my best to make her talk to me. It's a good thing, because sometimes, even though she's annoying and loud, she tends to make her way through me sometimes -- eventually... and then it happens... <newline> <newline> I'm really starting to forget about her. <newline> <newline> But that doesn't stop me from having sexual fantasies about this cyborg female. <newline> <newline> But that doesn't stop me from thinking this is the way I'm going to save her. <newline> <newline> I hope she is happy, and I hope she goes through okay... <|endoftext|>
[WP] [ EU ] [ TT ] You 've opened the door to a genie from the past to grant you three wishes in the future . <|startoftext|> The djinn was a normal guy, just a normal person, but to this genie it came. His name was Heisenberg and he was the djinn destined to grant me three wishes but it never happened. There is more to life than what ever lives, but what I wished for, was what I wished for. <newline> <newline> I awoke in a forest I now called "home", a place where I didn't sleep or eat. As I tried it was not so very comfortable, there were trees with leaves and it seemed so inviting. My only friend at the time was a lady I thought I'd never see or hear again and I wasn't alone. <newline> <newline> "You've found the place, this one's a good place to stay" That's what I told the djinn, that's what the djinn told me <newline> <newline> Now I'm here and I see a man who has the same name as me. He says hi and says "I come for your soul but I can not grant you these wishes,
