 came as the sound of the shotgun rifled through the air . The man looked at what he wanted to take with , seeing that he had almost all his equipment on him . The man walked to the front of the gang , he made his way to the far end of the group , the two men who were guarding the end of the line . <newline> <newline> The three men in the front had a shotgun aimed right for the man , they had no choice but to shoot . As the gun went off the men in the back of the line all dropped to the ground . One of the men lay motionless , the other shot a man in the right leg . The guy screamed , and a loud thud sounded through the streets . <newline> <newline> <newline> `` So that 's how it works that way '' I said . The man who the men in the front were firing behind me , looking for the man who stood in the center . I saw her approach , and then he was covered in white spandex and wearing a mask . <newline> <newline> `` Hello gangsters , it 's the beautiful lady who will be helping me with my job . '' The man in the mask walked forward , I stopped and watched as he spoke `` You will come with me now . '' He then spun around and aimed at me .

[ FF ] Fight scene . <|startoftext|> I sat slumped against my bike . On top of the bike wheel , we sat . <newline> <newline> And in that moment I knew it would all be over soon . I 'd been through the movies and I know what they were about... <newline> <newline> *They 're after us* <newline> <newline> But they got me . I knew then that it was over *but I still had ten minutes* <newline> <newline> We could n't keep going that fast . We had been up and down a couple of blocks and I did n't like the idea of being found out . I did n't want to get caught , so I stayed strong . <newline> <newline> I sat in the passenger seat , watching the headlights of the black Ford , the black Mercedes , as they rounded the corner and hit the ground . <newline> <newline> I did n't stand up much after that . It was just a bit of a shock . The thought of leaving here made me feel scared , nervous , and a bit disappointed that I ended up with five police cars looking for me , and that 's when I saw him coming up behind me . He made to go off without hesitation , and I knew what was going to happen . <newline> <newline> *What the fuck ? * <newline> <newline> I got on my bike and turned the wheel . The sound of the car hitting the ground followed by more gunshots made me feel like a movie character , too tired of being trapped in his apartment with the gangsters . With the speed of the bike wheels smashing into the pavement , the next thought was if this was the right time for me to do this .

I ca n't escape this wheel , but my feet ca n't stand it all . I ca n't get on my hands and knees . I ca n't move . I ca n't do anything . <newline> <newline> *The fuck , man , I 'm going to hurt you ! * <newline> <newline> The next moment I knew it was over . I was dead . I knew that it was over for me , I knew that we 'd both died here . I knew what was coming next , which was the death of another passenger , but it was n't what I wanted to hear .
