 "I'm in a good mood anyway." <newline> <newline> "That's great, I guess... good day." <newline> <newline> "That's your good day too, thanks." <newline> <newline> "Well..." <newline> <newline> "Oh no, the news." <|endoftext|>
[WP] `` God was just a dick '' <|startoftext|> It has be many centuries since human civilisation started, so much of it has fallen into disrepair, some still say God is dead, but those are the only words that come before and after a death. <newline> <newline> As the first humans entered the unknown they discovered the source of life. They found a long empty planet which seemed to be connected to other worlds. This was not the land, it lay barren and devoid to life, they found no life, all lived only the one life inside of the planet, it was a constant struggle for survival, but eventually the population was too big, and a rebellion was born, but these were not the people ; they were all the few who believed in God but their rebellion was too small compared to the amount of numbers the masses were up to that day. <newline> <newline> They started from the same point though, the old man, God, was not real, it had been millennia, the old man had no real idea what was happening. But this was not enough, as one of the leading voices had been caught up in the game, trying to figure out what would be the event that would happen if humanity ever stopped trying to reach other stars. <newline> <newline> But the voice that had been talking became real, it said, and God was dead. The last thing that came from this thing was something as simple as a "Hello, this is the human voice, please respond". <|endoftext|>
[WP] You are the king <|startoftext|> I am the king. I am everyone who ever lived. <newline> <newline> Every day we sit at the same table, with our food and our people. We eat at identical plates and drink our food in the same manner, yet no one will ever see the same person with the same attire. For years we had our palace. We even had our house as one. I am the king, I am my people. <newline> <newline> We all have our roles and our hopes. None of us are worthy. Some people were born that way, others are born with some other role as well. I do not envy any of us. We are all the best people on earth, the best hope we can have for our future, our future is all but decided. <newline> <newline> For me, I am happy to eat. The food is delicious. The people are happy, but at the same time we are all the best, the best, our destiny is to never leave earth. <newline> <newline> My people are happy. I have never seen another human being love such a young child. <newline> <newline> I love each of us, yet sometimes I feel that I must leave my home and move abroad, a man and woman together, no more. <newline> <newline> We will survive, I will survive, as long as every little thing is ok and that makes sense. <|endoftext|>
[WP] Write me something that will make me want to go outside . Write me something that will make me want to go inside . <|startoftext|> The moon was a different color every day. It was a different shade of grey, like a different kind of blood. There was no life in the sky. <newline> <newline> And every day life became more mysterious. The world was coming together as a nation. Every day we saw movement, and everyone cheered. We saw joy and sadness and fear. Everyone was smiling, I saw it in their eyes. <newline> <newline> They were in groups, I was there with my friends and neighbors. I was there with my friends and neighbors. I went out with them in the evening. We were in the park, my friend Amy was there. She was there to look at her, I took her with me. She was beautiful, she was alive, I had no time to look at her. A man that came out of the park was there with me, looking at me, talking to me, giving me love, and telling him that I needed to go outside and live my life, and be with him. The man got mad, yelling about how he didn't want to go outside, but Amy said yes. I hugged her tight. I told her that I loved her even though I wasn't her best friend, but it
