======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 There are moments where I feel that something is wrong . One time we could have met , one time we are supposed to be married ... I mean , marriage is just a fancy word for life at a party . At parties . We were already married before I was conceived , were we not ... <newline> <newline> `` What about our kids , Timmy ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Ugh , Dad did n't want them ... They 're older than me , '' my son replied with slight distaste . <newline> <newline> `` Do you want them so bad ? '' <newline> <newline> `` No ! No , I want them so bad ! '' <newline> <newline> `` Look , dad , I 'm not telling you to get married or what ! '' <newline> <newline> `` It does n't matter what it is . '' <newline> <newline> My son looked confused . <newline> <newline> 'We 'll have to talk about it tomorrow ' <newline> I was still trying to comprehend what his dad was going to say , when my cell rang , it was my mother , she had just finished setting up our appointment , and we had a long and emotional talk with her later in the evening . <newline> <newline> Suddenly I saw my wife waving at me from across the room , my eyes immediately met hers at the top of her head , my palms started sweating , and then I felt it . I tried my best to hide my surprise and then I was face to face with my son , my youngest son . <newline> <newline> `` Is n't it funny how things like we seem so familiar to you ? '' he asked , looking at me with a slight smile on his face . My hands slowly turned upwards , and I waved my hand in front of my face towards my son . I looked away , and we both shook . <newline> <newline> `` No , you 're not , '' he said in an angry tone , `` I 'm sorry , '' he went on , trying to get the most out of me . `` I did n't think that it had to be like this , I just wanted to see us together . '' he tried to talk through his tears , but instead of shaking I just shook my hand . <newline> <newline> `` What do you want , dad ? '' i asked , my voice was n't so confident . <newline> <newline> `` I just wanted -- to see you again , for the first time ! '' he laughed , tears now running down his face , and his smile turned into a smile . `` ... Dad ! I wanted to see you again ! '' and my heart started racing , this time as deep as the ocean . <newline> <newline> I tried to pull away . <newline> <newline> `` No , I promise , I 'll never go back there on this , I 'm so proud of you , '' he kissed my neck and smiled at my smile , tears now running down my face . We left the church hall , and I found myself in the middle of nowhere , where I was told by my mother about the trip , and the strange situation they had , and it turned out to be our last chance to see each other . <newline> <newline> `` I love you ! '' I could n't stop the tears from coming , so I cried , and while shaking my head , my eyes were already back at the church in the sky . <|endoftext|>
[WP] You â€™ re a soldier trapped on an alien space station . It turns out that every planet in known space is home to at least one human , and for some reason none seem to be home to a member of your species . <|startoftext|> I look at the ship and the people of my friends , a bunch of them , and I notice something strange , not only was they behaving according to their laws , but the planet I 'm on was n't any different from mine . It was n't a planet that was any different from the ones that were left behind : earth , Venus , Mars . <newline> <newline> `` You know , we look a lot like them , '' I say , staring out the window . <newline> <newline> `` Sure , '' a chirpy girl from the cafeteria says . There are at least three members of each planet , and that 's not going to change . <newline> <newline> `` This is n't their home , but that 's not exactly surprising , '' I say . `` What 's not surprising is that we are the only people here , and you are not one of them , '' I gestured to a small , blue-tinted pod next to my
