[WP] Write a short story that ends with the line , `` Boy , what a day . '' <|startoftext|> Boy , what a day ! As far back as I can remember , you 've known every inch of the world . Every thing you see is only an inch away . But I could have thought back to that for long ; you think that all that is ever written on my pages are the words that make this world real ? <newline> <newline> I always write things on paper ; they make more sense when they actually are written down . The ones that make the most sense are the ones that you 've come to love are the ones that make your heart beat in your head and smile at you . <newline> <newline> I 'll write a great story about everything . This is true for many , but the last two chapters on this page , they are my favorite . I wrote this story , a whole series of stories on what it means to live the hard life of a young man . My life has always had a sense of adventure , I 'm proud to say . I was born and raised , to be a parent . I 've always been excited . I wanted to do something , I wanted to be out of the house . But the life has a point , and I have a long way to go . <newline> <newline> After years of hard work and living for years on end , I have decided that I have grown far enough for this life , to be with my family . They must tell me stories of their great-grandchildren that I never wrote down . But I 'll keep their stories , I have grown to like this family . I will write about them all . That day soon will be my birthday- as it always has . <newline> <newline> *I 'm not sure if this was the right choice , but I really want to know it ! * <|endoftext|>
[WP] Write the final log of a research log , or write a random comment . <|startoftext|> 1 ) I think the most interesting thing about this experiment is that we are in the very middle of a full-scale galactic war with a few dozen superclusters . We are almost at the edge of the largest galaxy . <newline> <newline> 2 ) There is currently a species in the sky that is similar to humans , in fact they seem to have developed technology far beyond what the average human is capable of right now . Perhaps we will see such beings from a distance . <newline> <newline> 3 ) The human species seems to be on their peak intelligence , a few million units above that of any other . I doubt it 's too late to detect any other intelligent lifeforms , and if so , nothing much has happened . They are likely still in their infancy stages , but the new generation will not be able to develop the basic tools and tools for their interstellar empires . <newline> <newline> 4 ) I am not sure I ever believed they were intelligent enough to make such a claim . Perhaps we will learn to accept it when we find out . <|endoftext|>
