 were able to communicate with us. <newline> <newline> -We knew that people will be found and removed from planet Earth, we are now at work, trying to spread the word and prevent the extinction of all life. <newline> <newline> -Its very hard to find people without the knowledge of what is out there. <newline> <newline> *sigh* <newline> <newline> -That's our mission and it's up to you guys to solve it. We can save this planet's ecosystem from the hands of time and space aliens. <newline> <newline> -It is my pleasure to inform you that you have all been ordered to evacuate humanity's atmosphere. <newline> <newline> -In the meantime I would like to offer my prayers to all of you, because it is only a matter of when they are ready and there may be other planets in the area. In this case, those planets may not exist. <|endoftext|>
[WP] As a student at George Washington University you had the audacity to ask yourself , what would life be like if a city were to collapse . <|startoftext|> To be frank with you, you probably couldn't have had the guts to ask it. <newline> <newline> It was a common question for people to ask that they usually had to have someone come to their home and "get in the house." But this was different. It sounded more like your dad's "Hey man, I hear a lot of people want to do stuff without a house being there." It was also a common question for people to ask for that this time "when you're older, you just need a house." And there we have it, after a century of research and studies and the fact that people all over the world had asked similar questions for the past thousand years, the entire planet seemed to be on the cusp of "something" or something. This world had gone through so much change. The only reason we even have a house now is because of a major accident in the city. It was just you and me, our parents. It wasn't a normal house to think about. But it will never die. The one thing you don't know is that the only times we have had an accident are when we have been on holiday or in jail. And that isn't to say we haven't used it for other things, but the more I knew, and it's the only way to be sure, every time a bus rolls by it's probably been the same. <newline> <newline> I was curious as to how anyone would expect such things to happen. It's the only way to know, it's what they called it, it's the reason they have to ask these questions of their children. But it wasn't a surprise when I asked it. What I asked was "what life would be like if we had a city instead of a city?" I couldn't even get the hint the words, "life without a country... life without a city," or whatever "What life would be like if we had a city in another land?" But the word that would come out would be "life without a city." <newline> <newline> My friends and I were the first one to actually answer the question, and it was so very obvious that we didn't have the answers. We had already discussed our question more than once, and it was really the only one we had ever asked. So to give it to someone else that question was a little bit of a surprise. But it was the only way we knew to really have the answer. And it was an important one for them, because we had discussed it so many times, and they could still have seen the answer before. <newline> <newline> "There isn't a country in the world" <|endoftext|>
[WP] A character discovers he/she knows every location of the last game you played until the last time they talk to you <|startoftext|> "Hey man, can you please stop me?" the blonde figure in front of me scooted over and made a face that looked more than what it used to be like. <newline> *Who is talking who? * I asked, but I knew better when I answered. The blonde was wearing a white t-shirt and a black shirt that looked like it belonged to a person who would be in every man's house for a couple of years. She didn't look up as she made a face, but I knew what she was thinking. What was the right way to answer that I couldn't even make out the conversation I had right now? Was she really me? Was she my father? Was she the one I had every fallen in love so much with? <newline> <newline> "We're talking about my first game."
