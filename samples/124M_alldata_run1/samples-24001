newline> <newline> What I have here I will not say , <newline> <newline> In any great book ; <newline> <newline> No more of the land , <newline> <newline> It will be to a great and pitiful end . <newline> <newline> You shall have one day , <newline> <newline> Where are you , again , <newline> <newline> to learn ? <newline> <newline> <|endoftext|>
[WP] Write something that ends with : `` I told you so . '' <|startoftext|> So , I guess I just do n't wan na lie . <newline> <newline> I saw an asshole as a kid . We watched on TV that he 's a cop with a gun , and the cops who go by , I knew that he was just watching , for one reason or another . He 's not a real asshole . <newline> <newline> But you do n't know what 's going to happen . It is n't until we actually get that real bad guy who got the real bad guy . Then we 'll see what he could do with his power to kill anyone , we can just go through a normal school . <newline> <newline> So , I went up to watch him , and he 's standing there , with a gun in his hand . I asked him why , and he laughed . The first thing on his mind is a gun , but I have to understand . He says , `` why , why me ? '' <newline> <newline> I tell him it 's no use . I have to know what he was thinking , and I have to know where the gun is . But the guy looks so nervous . Why did he have to shoot us ? I could have helped , the cops all shot someone ; he can kill them . I told him he was a good guy . He said that his power was to live here , and if he wanted to stay , I could have . <newline> <newline> So I shot him , and we killed them all as well . We lived a nice life . We did n't die , we did n't get hurt . We did n't die . We did n't , but we did survive . <newline> <newline> How did he survive ? Well , they did n't kill everyone , but we had a lot of fun . But they made a mess with the school we wanted and the teachers were scared of the asshole , and they wanted to keep us here in their own school , but did n't want to go into the police station , because they did n't know what they were going to do with us . <newline> <newline> So I killed them . All of them . I did n't just do this to him , I did it in the library . <newline> <newline> I killed the last one , and I killed them all again . I killed them all . <newline> <newline> I killed them . I killed them . I killed them every day . <newline> <newline> So when it happens , I know . <newline> <newline> I was in a library when it happened . I lived alone with a book . There were many books , and they all had their own stories and histories to tell . That 's what was going on with me . But here I am , still reading and telling them the story of the world we know . I still feel that I am dead here in this library . I just know who I am . <newline> <newline> Now , I have to have him as my roommate . There is n't enough time to kill me , of course . I am not the killer he is . He may be the one with the gun . No one else knows it . <newline> <newline> But the one guy he is , he might kill me . I would have killed him , with just my power , but I ca n't do it now . For now , I am trapped in this place , with another monster who wanted to kill me , and it knows that I am the new man , the old woman who left my place before the police came around . <|endoftext|>
[WP] At 14 , every person has the right to choose who gets to live . You 're the first in which someone has chosen to die . For the rest of the time , you feel like a joke , but you slowly learn that there is no limit . <|startoftext|> `` Mr ... please ... do n't do this to me . It sounds so innocent , as a teenager , but I 've always had a taste for gore . Would you like to tell Mr. Sibil ? He 's
