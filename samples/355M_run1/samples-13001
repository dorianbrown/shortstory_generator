 mean that I was a little worried but I didn ’ t think about it at the time because it was my imagination . <newline> <newline> The house looked just like the one it felt like I was supposed to come to now . I could find it when I was almost two . I could see the windows and the ground under my feet . The windows would open at three in the evening . The ground felt so comfortable to sit on that night . The ground was soft and I could n't move much more than it took four of us to walk . <newline> <newline> I put a hand to my heart , trying to find something to hold back the guilt . <newline> <newline> A soft crack broke the silence . <newline> <newline> “ You remember us coming to this house ? ” I asked . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <|endoftext|>
[WP] A young woman realizes she has magical powers and is actually a magical being <|startoftext|> One moment , I was making a list of places to visit , and the next , being an average guy , I was in the waiting room with some dumbass trying to teach me all about magic . I watched as the man walked over to me . He did , in fact , teach me a lot about magic so I would think of things like that . The man looked at me quizzically and then smiled . <newline> <newline> `` What now , sweetie ? '' His voice was so soft you could feel it through your ears . <newline> <newline> `` Just remember '' <newline> <newline> Now that magic was no longer a fantasy , I had to start to take it seriously . I went in that damn room and looked through the various books and magazines that had a magic element to them . I looked at my name . <newline> <newline> `` How can you remember your magic ? ! '' His voice was so far above the level of human speech , he could hear the echo through my entire body . <newline> <newline> `` M-like you know , '' I stammered <newline> <newline> `` Of course ! Just as well , '' he continued , `` That would be if I 'd tried to learn magic of my own accord instead ! My magic just ... .just .... ... was too good and dangerous to try , '' he paused , almost glancing at me . <newline> <newline> `` Wait , seriously ? I have n't tried all of those things yet ? A magic that I could n't risk ? I can try it for real if you want just once . Are I supposed to go and ... . '' <newline> <newline> `` Of course ! '' he grinned and looked me in the eyes . <newline> <newline> I was frozen solid in the room and there were three of the man standing behind me , laughing . <newline> <newline> “ M-just kidding , and I did n't see anyone else there , so if you wanted a real version of that , you could go to my house ! I wo n't deny you that for long ! ” The man 's laugh was so loud I literally felt myself shaking uncontrollably , but I continued standing . <newline> <newline> `` M-just give this to them , let me look , but first , I need to go back to my family and I have to start my new life and then , okay , I 'm not stopping you ! What do you want to know ? If you give me any magical stuff ... '' <newline> <newline> `` Oh ! Really ? What will I do when my family ... '' I began yelling at him . <newline> <newline> `` I wo n't do anything ... .I-I want to be free . If you do n't want to start something , then I 'll let you continue to do whatever it is you want to do , just as long as you stop doing your bad deeds ! ” The man looked at me with those devilish eyes , that only a lunatic possessed . <newline> <newline> `` If you really love me , you could stop stopping my bad deeds and let me be happy again ! That 's all we want , right ? '' he chuckled to himself . <newline> <newline> * '' You 've got no idea . I 'll take care of your bad deeds ... in a few ... * <newline> <newline> ** <newline> <newline> You must be familiar with the typical list of things to want to do while in your 20s , and you must decide how often . <newline> <new
