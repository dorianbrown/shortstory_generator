[WP] Take a typical day and turn it into a horror story . <|startoftext|> The men sat in front of their desk . The two on the back row wore nothing to hide their terror . The one next to them looked as though they were sitting . This was probably the last time they would see each other . <newline> <newline> As the two men walked the hall , the other one stared at the ceiling . But this was a perfect picture . The men stood by the building 's entrance and watched from a distance , as the floor below them began to slowly descend down into the earth . <newline> <newline> The sound of the doorbell rang . The two men had heard it before but just as quickly as the door open , The door was broken and cracked . The door fell to the floor and the two men fell to the floor . They heard a soft creaking in the door . *Crack . Crack . Crack . Crack . Crack . Crack ! * <newline> <newline> They had no idea what the banging would be like , but they all looked at each other in shock as they looked again <newline> <newline> One door cracked open . They all fell to the floor . <newline> <newline> The door opened again . <newline> <newline> The two men watched on , stunned . It had n't even broken down into the metal . It had been three hours had it been open . <newline> <newline> *crack to silence . * <newline> <newline> The door opened again . <newline> <newline> `` How could this happen ? '' <newline> <newline> He looked across the room . It had been at least five minutes since he heard the shattering . <newline> <newline> *crack to silence . * <newline> <newline> The house had been flooded with water and firebomb shells on the way in . <newline> <newline> *crack to silence . * <newline> <newline> The house had been flooded with water over the course of a hundred days . <newline> <newline> *crack to silence . * <newline> <newline> The house had been flooded with water over the course of a hundred years as well . <newline> <newline> *crack to silence . * <newline> <newline> *crack to silence . * <newline> <newline> The house now had a large open floor with dozens of firetowers , a large open door without lights , a large open ceiling with no ceiling fan , a large open ceiling with a large wide open door with an open door on the bottom with no exit window . <newline> <newline> *crack to silence . * <newline> <newline> The air had become toxic now . <|endoftext|>
[WP] The world just went to shit and now nobody is watching . <|startoftext|> It was a very good day . After a few months of working out with the guys at Microsoft 's Office 365 , I had finally started working on my first real project for Microsoft 's Office . I was just finishing writing a first-level essay at Microsoft about the next logical progression in human evolution and how we would continue . Finally , I figured I might as well try to write down my work in a little bit , with my thoughts , so as not to have my work mis-written . <newline> <newline> I sat down with these guys and was about to have a great time making some great writing for a new article they 'd just started . <newline> <newline> So I read out a couple paragraphs out in some of the comments . <newline> <newline> `` So I just wrote this ...
