 ( I should know . We were running on the most powerful source of light in the universe . As we ran , we lost count of the number of times my friend and I had passed through our path . It had been an eternity since I had seen him , since the light was dying . For the last four years , we kept moving forward . Now we were at the end of my journey , I was finally beginning to see what other things lie at the far end of the universeâ€”to our horror and horror alone . <newline> <newline> -- <newline> <newline> There 's something different about this one that never stopped repeating in my mind . <newline> <newline> -- <newline> <newline> `` It 's not like I could go into deep thought and change history , '' she says , holding up the small box . `` I could see the light fading out like it was on fire , like it was stuck in the ground a long time . Just as the last light disappeared , I was just standing on the path . '' <newline> <newline> -- <newline> <newline> `` When we first came to the place I could feel it , that was when I first saw it . '' <newline> <newline> -- <newline> <newline> `` The place that I stood on my journey to , that I have seen my friend face , was the place I never left and it felt like it did . I stood there , watching it fade out , watching it hit me . The darkness . Not the darkness of the darkness . The darkness of the abyss . No , the darkness of the deep darkness , the dark of the darkness , this dark darkness which I know to be mine , was mine alone . It did not go on in vain. `` <newline> <newline> -- <newline> <newline> With tears in my eyes I could only ask , `` Why me ? Why did you leave me ? '' <newline> <newline> -- <newline> <newline> `` Because I saw my own darkness , the darkness that consumed me . '' <newline> <newline> -- <newline> <newline> `` It does n't understand , it does n't understand , '' she said , grabbing one of her tumblers , `` It could have , it could have seen me , but it did n't . It never does . '' <newline> <newline> -- <newline> <newline> `` What happened , what was this darkness I could n't see , and why ? Why not me ? I could have stopped time , I could have been here , I could have just left me to pass on . Maybe it could have helped , maybe it could have changed its past , maybe it could have been someone who had found its own light . Someone who had found a way . But it was no one who I had loved , no one who was going to help me , not after I passed on , '' <newline> <newline> -- <newline> <newline> `` Where would I go , you ask ? I could never go anywhere without a light , '' I said to her , `` But I never could 've stopped time , I never was . I would never be able to stop the darkness . And those were my friends , and if I had nicked myself , and they had found me , they 'd never have found me . No , you could n't do that . '' <newline> <newline> -- <newline> <newline> `` She could n't tell me she was with me , either , '' I said , `` but now I understand , now I understand why she left us . '' <newline> <newline> -- <newline> <newline> `` The darkness left us . But the darkness still had n't been here for the darkness 's first time- '' <newline> <newline> -- <newline> <newline> `` Where will I go , you ask ? I could never go anywhere without a light , '' I said to her , `` but I never could 've stopped time , I never was . I would never be able to stop the darkness . But those were my friends , and we 'd never found out what we were hiding- no one who we could 've loved could 've . '' <newline> <newline> -- <newline> <newline> `` And now the darkness came back , with my shadow- '' <newline> <newline> -- <newline> <newline> `` No one is out there with me . '' <newline> <newline> -- <newline> <newline> `` The darkness does n't leave us . The darkness comes back with the light- '' <newline> <newline> -- <new
