 a story about the hero and the villain ’ s secret identity . <newline> <newline> “ We should have seen him ! ” I screamed and slapped him . He looked at me in shock and looked away . At the moment , I could see only the look of despair on his face . <newline> <newline> “ Where… Where am I ? ” he was crying . I had not felt more emotion in a long time . <newline> <newline> Suddenly , the sky lit up with the sudden brightness of the sun . The darkened sky . The moon . <newline> <newline> “ Sir , I ’m sorry for what happened . ” <newline> <newline> “ We don ’ t have to help you . Please. ” <newline> <newline> “ I don ’ t understand . I think we need a change . It ’ s my home , and I need you to leave , ” I tried to sound strong but I was already feeling weak . <newline> <newline> “ I need the help. ” <newline> <newline> “ You can go now . Please. ” <newline> <newline> “ How are we going to get help ? ” <newline> <newline> “ We just haven ’ t the time to keep you here , ” I said sternly but she felt uneasy . <newline> <newline> “ It ’ s fine. ” <newline> <newline> “ We just need help with the situation we ’ ve been in for a while. ” <newline> <newline> “ It ’ s not our fault. ” <newline> <newline> “ Yes , it is . But our job is to protect us , not you. ” <newline> <newline> “ I ’ ll do it for you , ” she said . I knew this was going to happen someday , but I wanted to do it this time . <newline> <newline> “ I have a name , I need to know… ” <newline> <newline> “ No , it ’ s not just that. ” <newline> <newline> “ No…it ’ s important. ” <newline> <newline> “ Just…it ’ s something to do . It needs you. ” <newline> <newline> I knew this was going to happen , or at least , I suspected this job was at least partly to my benefit , but now I knew I could get away with it . <newline> <newline> “ I know we have our work cut out , but we need this help. ” <newline> <newline> “ Of course ! I know you will have to have this help too. ” <newline> <newline> “ You will have to , ” I thought as I reached into my bag . <newline> <newline> “ What do you need ? ” <newline> <newline> “ Nothing. ” <newline> <newline> “ I can tell you everything . But you can not leave… ” <newline> <newline> “ But she is my wife. ” <newline> <newline> “ Oh . You never heard what you would need without asking. ” <newline> <newline> “ No you never understand. ” <newline> <newline> “ I don ’ t want to hear it any more. ” <newline> <newline> “ Oh . Do you remember this little girl we were talking about ? ” He looked at me as if I was a madman . It was a very small smile on his face . <newline> <newline> “ Why would you want to hear that. ” <newline> <newline> “ Do it . There is no other time. ” <newline> <newline> “ No . There is nowhere to go , there is nothing else. ” <newline> <newline> “ It is only to protect her. ” <newline> <newline> “ This is the only way out. ” <newline> <newline> “ My husband is my only son. ” <newline> <newline> “ It is to protect us. ” <newline> <newline> “ Why did you ask ? ” <newline> <newline> “ He wanted to see me again
