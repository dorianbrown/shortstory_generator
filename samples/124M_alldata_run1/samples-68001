 to look upon my father as my eyes adjusted to the harsh light surrounding us . I could see only his silhouette against the bleak white of the field . It only ever shone for once before it was broken away , a shadow of its former self . From his silhouette came a voice , an almost fearful but clear one . `` I am the wind , and I am your father . '' <|startoftext|> `` Are we all the wind that blows in this day and age again ? '' The old woman asked her friend , an old frail man I had once known as our father in a world filled with war . `` Yes . '' I reply . The old woman sits back down in her chair , her face a deep frown , as she stares back at me with a smile that could crush any child . As I stare back at her I find myself questioning her , `` So why were we created as a great gift for the world to know so they could be more united than we were ? '' `` It 's not for the world to know . It 's for us now . '' I continue to stare at the old woman , a question almost too much to ask . <newline> <newline> It was only a few weeks back before he spoke again . `` You were one of two people who chose to become true , and not just to be the wind , but to take it from me . You took a little of it away from me . We were never taught , but I will never forget that one day , as you said , it will all return to you . '' The tears in the old woman 's eyes fall from her face and she looks back at me over her shoulder smiling to the people who had gathered here today . `` It will take time , but I know it will do . '' The old woman grabs at her hair and tears her veil back as she says . The crowd begins to murmur and they all gaze at us , each at the same time . `` We were made here , in this day , for someone else but the wind can not find that someone else . We were never meant to be in this world or die here , to suffer alone . It will just be you . With your friend in front of you there will be me . And the wind will be on your back ... .. *bong* . ..*bong* '' The old woman walks past us and up the hill into the night . <newline> <newline> I can see her standing there looking at the wind and she smiles at me , `` I see you do too son .

[ CC ] The Hero and the Demon . A couple of problems I see . <|startoftext|> I have issues that I 'm not familiar with . There 's a whole lot that I do n't understand and I ca n't keep up with what I 'm doing . I really do n't understand why the MC did n't get to fight him . I ca n't put this piece together without a few typos or poor writing skills . <newline> <newline> Also ? I think the first line feels like an unnecessary loop . I 'm confused here . Did n't expect him to get killed as fast as this piece . How did he get an attacker ? Why did n't he use a weapon ? <newline> <newline> I 'm not sure what kind of constructive criticism you can get . <|endoftext|>
[WP] You 've always wanted to be a writer . You 've always been into sci-fi , fantasy , comedy and even romance . Then you wake up . <|startoftext|> I did n't want to be a writer after all . I decided to study , go through my hobbies and read my old books . <newline> <newline> First of all , I wrote a lot . For the most part , I tried to understand and learn some skills and knowledge . I wanted to be an editor . A writer . If I could 've just become an editor or a journalist , I would 've do what I did very well . <newline> <newline> Secondly , I 've been writing for years , writing and reading and reading novels and maybe more . However , lately , I 'm actually starting to get bored and writing . I 've been working on a book and a few other projects as well . I want to read more than a day . <newline> <newline> Finally , I just got off my train now . Well , I 'll start off at the second step , but I got ta get going first . The only thing I 'm going to do now is to go back and read everything I 've read . <newline> <newline> A single page . An article is going to be delivered . <newline> <newline> `` An article is going to be delivered . '' <newline> <
