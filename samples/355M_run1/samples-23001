 the new arrival . I did n't have much of a choice . I had had many adventures with my companions . I had seen the wonders to be seen with their natural wonders . My eyes did n't focus on what you would assume to be their appearance , I was just staring at their beauty . <newline> <newline> `` You want to go see something ? '' <newline> `` I 'll see you soon , I 've grown quite... well , too much of an enamour for your tastes . '' <newline> <newline> I said as I placed a hand on the new arrival 's shoulder . There was no feeling of being loved . Or maybe that 's why I believed it was a gift , a way to pass time . I 'm sure they knew who I was . <newline> <newline> `` I thought you 'd be nice . Now let go of me . '' <newline> <newline> I felt my own skin being turned into a pale brown . I let my eyes roll away and I felt them fill up with the same shade of red . I was done . The pain was gone . <newline> <newline> I had just left my friends and family , I wanted them to see me well and I did n't know what I would do with myself . This man had done so much to make this moment what it was . And here I was , walking out of a prison . <newline> <newline> `` You see I 'm very sorry sir , but due to our mission I do n't have much time . '' <|endoftext|>
[WP] The first manned mission to Mars <|startoftext|> `` Sir , I do n't think the landing site is exactly 20 by 10, and the landing is over . '' <newline> <newline> `` We are currently in orbit , and we do n't think it can move us far enough in the direction of the Mars landing we require . '' <newline> <newline> `` Can you repeat that ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Correct . '' <newline> <newline> `` Are you ready for the launch ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Not yet . '' <newline> <newline> `` Are you ready to hit the atmosphere ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Yes . '' <newline> <newline> `` Are you ready to launch ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Do it . '' <newline> <newline> `` Good . '' <newline> <newline> `` Good . '' <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> `` This has all gone about so much faster than expected . We have to be up in less than a half hour and be off by a week . If possible , make it an earlier landing , so we can try again . '' <newline> <newline> <newline> `` Good . The moon is nearly up . '' <newline> <newline> The launch control screen was silent . <newline> <newline> <newline> `` The rocket is just now landing . We are holding . '' <newline> <newline> A loud click sounded and it was over . <newline> <|endoftext|>
[WP] Write a story that ends with the sentence `` I wish the world were a happier place with the present . '' <|startoftext|> `` You always told me you wished the worlds to be a *better* place , right ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Yes . '' I say as I pick up my piece of rubble . <newline> <newline> We both lean together , arms outstretched . <newline> <newline> In the distance , I can see flames rising up . <newline> <newline> I turn around once more . <newline> <newline> `` We 're back in space on Earth ! '' I say , smiling . <newline> <newline> I reach down and grab her hand . <newline> <newline> `` I know , I know , I 've just been making that comment all those times ! '' We laugh together , turning toward the other side of the crater . `` I ca n't wait to spend the rest of my allowance with you and you ! '' <newline> <newline> She smiles back , pulling away . <newline> <newline> `` You got me , right ? '' I ask him . <newline> <newline> He laughs with a smile on his face . <newline> <newline> As we walk away , I see through our eyes , a million years later , how that same smile still
