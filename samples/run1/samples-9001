 translates your name to another body after you . '' <newline> <newline> `` I , uh , do n't understand . But it 's not *you* , man . It 's your father . I 'm your father ! I ca n't believe it -- '' He got a half-hearted cough in -- not really getting away from the point . It was a look of worry and anxiety mixed with the cold , a coldness that seemed to cling to a man . <newline> <newline> `` Oh God , oh Michael . '' <newline> <newline> My father was n't going to answer . <|endoftext|>
[WP] You sold your soul to a demon to get rid of you , but now your body is possessed by the demon . <|startoftext|> I never expected it to come to this , the first of its kind . I always told the other men to never speak to those they 're with , not to touch them . What can you do but try ? I thought that if I just spoke one word I could have them take their souls with me . I was wrong . <newline> <newline> As I was leaving my apartment , I took a picture of my reflection and decided I 'd do one more . As I passed into the kitchen of the family home , the man 's shadow loomed over our table . I tried to take a moment to reflect on his reaction as he leaned over , cupping my palm , pulling me towards the edge of the table and smiling . <newline> <newline> I knew this was n't the best option , you know what 's not good . I did n't care if the demons were chasing these poor souls , I was n't about to put this into anyone . The thought seemed to slow , but then it started growing . I never thought of any harm we could do to these souls . Why did n't we give them a chance ? <newline> <newline> What seemed to happen was I began to shake a bit more , my arms felt heavy , feeling the weight of the demon on my body . Suddenly , my hands gripped tighter , I just hoped I was not going to break . He was in the doorway of the room . <newline> <newline> He grabbed me , my hands clutching him , and my legs shaking . He grabbed her again and I could feel her hands grasping my face tighter , but he was shaking more . He let go of her , and I heard him grab me . <newline> <newline> I did n't do much more , I did n't have a clue what I was doing . I tried to go back to my apartment , but my hands shook , and I could feel the demon around me . It was coming back , and it was almost a demonic attack . Then it hurt . I did n't want to stop , but I was trembling so hard . As I fell into a dark , uncomfortable void my hands clenched . I did n't move . I felt it . I felt my life slipping away . I knew what had happened , I had won . I just prayed that this would be enough to stop before I became the darkness that I was . <newline> <newline> Then the darkness . I still ca n't find it , it 's all too much . A dark shadow is closing in , creeping up on the edges , looking for us . I do n't feel it . I could feel the demon 's gaze , it 's eyes . They 're on me ... my eyes are looking at me ! I 'm not doing well here , I do n't have any legs . It 's almost time , now . I need the rest of what I have saved to get my life back . <newline> <newline> EDIT : Thanks for the love of the franchise ! <|endoftext|>
[WP] You wake up one morning to find that your alarm clock has been ringing for the past 30 minutes . <|startoftext|> My alarm clock was on my bedside table as usual . I was going to move downstairs , but it was late . I did n't want to leave them behind me . <newline> <newline> I closed my eyes and closed them again . I was almost asleep when the alarm clock began to ring again . As I stood up , I realized what had happened . <newline> <newline> I 'm sitting in my bathroom , trying to take my first breaths of sleep . <newline> <newline> In the beginning it did n't stop . Not from the phone alarm ringing , but from another noise . But as soon as it started , I started wondering if I should try to make sure it was n't going to ring again . I got up and went to my bathroom , but the phone was still not ringing . I tried to get a good look
