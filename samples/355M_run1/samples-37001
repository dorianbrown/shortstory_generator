 the death of the universe . <newline> <newline> The people were watching in the corner of their windows and watching . <newline> <newline> `` And we are not the last people ? '' Said the man and he spoke in his calm , calm tone . <newline> <newline> `` That is not my question . We are not the last people . '' Said the woman . <newline> <newline> `` I did n't think I would need to be so specific , but it 's ... it 's not as if I do n't already know you , we are one . '' Said the man before vanishing back to the shadows of the moon . <newline> <newline> On the corner , there sat a man in a suit . The man looked back at me and grinned . `` I have never had such a strange moment . '' <newline> <newline> `` I 'm sorry , but I guess there is just a question . '' <newline> <newline> `` Yes , a query you had to ask ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Yes . '' <newline> <newline> `` Where am I ? '' I asked as I was about to talk more about my life or just a question . <newline> <newline> `` It 's because you can feel us . '' <newline> <newline> `` Well , you have to do something , it 's hard to know if you can really feel someone when you ca n't even feel myself . '' <newline> <newline> `` No ! '' I said before my mind was filled with darkness . <newline> <newline> `` We 've known you for a long time , have n't we ? '' <newline> <newline> `` I guess this is why I did n't think there was much left to say . '' <newline> <newline> `` And , why the hell are you still talking ? '' <newline> <newline> I smiled and waved . `` It 's just to let you know we hear you . Thank you for listening . '' <|endoftext|>
[WP] A man dies of cancer but finds that he is reincarnated as a mouse , and is now trying to cure it but the only way to do that is give the mouse a cure . <|startoftext|> The doctor had told me that it was actually a disease of the lungs and not the mind , though . I ’ d heard it before from the news anchors on national TV , but never thought it would get into the mail . I had no idea how to treat a disease , not until a month later when I had been referred to a specialist at a hospital in the Bronx . <newline> <newline> The man who worked there , whom I wouldn ’ t name , wasn ’ t just a mad scientist . He was an actual scientist who could cure cancer . He was a genius , in the sense of not only knowing everything , but also calculating his knowledge into a spreadsheet . The spreadsheet , apparently written by some crazy genius named Dr. Johnathan , covered the entire spectrum of human mental illness , including bipolar and depression , and even cancer , in his opinion , did not reflect that . I would tell him he was just crazy . <newline> <newline> I had found a cure for cancer , one that was almost like no other I had heard of . I had been on treatment for years , and it was finally time . Now , the doctor and I were going through a clinical trial . <newline> <newline> The procedure was easy . There , the cancer was cured . The next thing I needed was a mouse . The mouse ’ s brain was perfectly preserved , with everything I could say about my condition already stored as I became more and more insane . The last part was up to me- all I had to do was ask . I would ask , ask , ask to be cured . But when the man reached the mouse the mouse could not answer , no . The mouse was gone . <newline> <newline> The only thing that followed was the mouse ’ s dying breath . The mouse was lost forever . The only way for me to do the right thing would be to give this mouse an entire lifetime to cure the disease . But then , I could only do that by giving the mouse immortality as much as I could . After all , immortality was the most powerful cure I had been able to discover . <newline> <newline> I found out that the patient was gone forever . I got to the bottom of it , and nothing had changed at all , not on the papers , not on the hospital records , not even on the mice . I didn ’ t even know if they were back . <newline> <newline> All the mice were gone . They were
