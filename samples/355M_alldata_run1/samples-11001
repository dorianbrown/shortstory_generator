As the other children in the school ran inside , hiding from their parents , the boy held his hand up to steady his bowie knife . <newline> <newline> `` This is n't the same . '' he spat , as he put the knife in its scabbard , and moved in close . A moment later his knife rested on the wooden railing , ready to strike the child in the heart . The boy 's eyes widened ; he knew what he had to do . <newline> <newline> He looked at his hand-in-hand knife . It would kill the boy , and save his life ... he was not sure . `` No , this is ... this is a *wish list ? * I was *tasty to get rid of *it* last year .
