 down . <newline> <newline> `` They want the cure for it for now '' . A soft sigh . <newline> <newline> `` No no we do n't . And if it works , we could never be cured . So here we are , waiting for Dr. Jenson to explain the process . `` Well , what did you do with the cure for the virus ? '' <|endoftext|>
[WP] After a terrible breakup , an old man and his empty apartment begin killing off the love of his life . They take the body into a dumpster . Years later a dog finds it and it is the first person in the apartment after the dog dies . <|startoftext|> You 'd think I 'd think he was happy with what he had done or that he had gotten away . After twenty years as the human embodiment of evil he was finally home . He has n't been this far away from the city to his friends and family . He had been waiting for his next stop for a long time now . He looked about fifty years and he seemed to have lost his sense of purpose again . I suppose it was because we had been getting together for twenty long years . He 'd thought the dog was an idiot , but the things he said helped him get over a broken heart . <newline> <newline> The dog was a very aggressive piece of work . He was smart as hell and could always get what he wanted . It took years of therapy to figure out how to get him to not be an idiot . <newline> <newline> The dog was always there and I could n't believe it . It was like he had been a dog forever , he had gotten it into every way , like he had n't grown up yet . He just kept disappearing and disappearing . One day , I finally asked him why he would do that and he would never reply . After a few more years and a few more months of him disappearing , there was a knock at the door . It was n't a knock on the door . It was a knock at my door . He had come back after I 'd been gone for a few months and seemed like the only logical conclusion . <newline> <newline> I opened the door and it was a familiar sight . A tall bald man with a suit and tie standing to the left of the door . He walked forward and held out a white card . He did n't even have time to look at my eyes , his mind was on him . <newline> <newline> `` Hello and welcome to the old man 's apartment and he will have your life ! '' He yelled into the receiver . <newline> <newline> I 'd never had a dog , ever . All I knew was I wanted it back . I had never felt like a dog again but it was n't so bad . I was n't unhappy . Sometimes I 'd wake up on a cold morning with a cold and a dog 's scent in my nose or I 'd get a cold and I 'd hear a barking bark . And then I 'd remember that it was n't really my dog but my dog . That 's all I 'm saying . I had been hoping for something like that at first but as he turned to leave , I heard a bark . <newline> <newline> `` What do you want , boy ? Where do you want me to take you ? '' The man asked . <newline> <newline> `` It 's alright , just give me a chance okay . '' The man answered but I was too weak to answer him . At least I was n't taking anything that did n't belong to me . It just was n't the right thing to do . Now that everything was settled , I left the old man for once . <newline> <newline> I walked away with my dog . At least that was an excuse . <|endoftext|>
[WP] You have a special bag . Whenever you reach into it , you pull out something you will need soon , but do n't necessarily know you need , but you know you need right now . <|startoftext|> `` ... I do n't use the bag . '' <newline> <newline> `` But , I think maybe it 's best to get one with the most useful , and yet useless , item . '' <newline> <newline> `` Look , it 's important , '' says the woman , looking up from the newspaper with a smile on her face , `` that we give our love to our son . We know he loves the idea of us helping him move in with his parents , and I know they 're fine to do so . But we 're just not able to give enough . '' <newline> <newline> The woman turns her face from her hand on the page and looks back down
