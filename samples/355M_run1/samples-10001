======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 of a young boy who was in trouble from his father . <newline> <newline> And then , my eyes met his . He was a poor soul , and could n't pay for the care of a young orphanage . I was a young boy . I was like the orphanage mother . <newline> <newline> We had the same problems . I had a boy in need . I was caring for him with a woman with deep pockets . And he never had anything to do in school . I wanted to help him , but he needed me the most . <newline> <newline> And I was . <newline> <newline> I could n't say that I 'm sorry for her , but I 'll tell you that I tried to do what I could . <newline> <newline> But today , it was about to be my first big break . I was going to be taking some cash on behalf of a new start-up . A well-known name was up for sale , and I had to sell her . I had to give him some cash . <newline> <newline> The young orphanage was full of people who knew each other by name , and they knew that I was a businessman with a good reputation . I 'd done something he had n't done in years , and he had n't had anything to do with at all . <newline> <newline> I 'd been waiting for this moment . <newline> <newline> I 'd wanted a big break , and for it to come at any price . When the time came , I gave myself a little push . <newline> <newline> <|endoftext|>

( Be sure to include `` and `` in quotes if you are reading a prompt that includes them . ) <|startoftext|> The wind was still as I crossed the bridge that connected my hotel to the harbor , a small breeze brushing against my face , still . I sighed and opened my eyes . A familiar scent floated into view like a comforting aroma of sandalwood or a fragrance like the scent of fresh grass . When I awoke the next day the perfume was replaced by a heavy scent of perfume , and I rubbed my eyes with the sandalwood from my hand . <newline> <newline> I had been trying since I had gotten hold of the island in the first place to find another . But when I finally got back home that perfume was gone and the scent of sandalwood was replaced by that of a stale , dull smell of soap . But I could still smell the sandalwood if you tried a dab of oil on my face and put your tongue around . And as far as that was concerned , but as far as the odor of soap was concerned , the perfume was even stronger than usual , at least that 's what I thought . <newline> <newline> That is where the smell came from . The perfume was coming from the soap . As far as I could tell , it was n't a smell that I could pick out ; it was some natural liquid that I had used to make something , a hot meal , or a cold drink , and the smell that I remembered was the oil on my tongue , so it did n't really matter that it was not just an oil made by me , it was also a smell I could n't explain without tasting : the scent was like it was mine , and I could feel the scent in my head when I was walking as well , and when I was with a group like hers it smelled like that feeling of being surrounded by a group of people I once knew and knew not to be there . I still remember the feeling of being surrounded , of the feeling of being alive inside of someone else . But I knew better , and it is now a feeling entirely different than that first sense in my brain of being safe . <newline> <newline> I can remember the smell of oil here for one
