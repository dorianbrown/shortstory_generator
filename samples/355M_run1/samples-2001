 I I 've got a few things to think about . '' He had a smile , at least . He 'd tried a few times . It was n't working . There was no way this would work . <newline> <newline> `` But why stop the madness ? I think we can make it work , '' I said to myself . I 'm tired of it , though . The more I saw of this place , the less I wanted to be here . <newline> <newline> `` Why would I ? '' he asked . `` Why would I n't want to ? '' <newline> <newline> `` You think my job is getting me here anyway ? '' he asked . <newline> <newline> `` No , '' I said . `` My job is getting me in here . Why would you want to be in here . '' <newline> <newline> `` Your job is getting me here , '' he said . <newline> <newline> `` I know . They have to be here , '' I said . This was n't something I liked about this place . I took a step . <newline> <newline> `` You can try again . '' <newline> <newline> `` No , not again . '' <newline> <newline> `` Why not ? '' <newline> <newline> `` I don ’ t know . But you ’ ve got to . '' <newline> <newline> `` I hate this place too . You should n't be here again . '' <newline> <newline> `` I ’ m sorry . I ’ m sorry I think I could be . We ’ re both tired of having to go to this place . But there is a better way , and I would take it . I would just love to keep going through with it . Just do n't give up . I would just take it , and the first couple of years would be nice . I would n't change anything if there was no more madness here . '' <newline> <newline> `` I ’ d like to get here . '' <newline> <newline> `` There isn ’ t anything wrong with being mad . I don ’ t think I like this place . I think it ’ s terrible . Sorry . '' <newline> <newline> `` What ? '' <newline> <newline> `` If you just put away the place . '' <newline> <newline> `` How ? '' <newline> <newline> `` I ’ d take your job back , and I ’ d take your insanity . I wouldn ’ t worry about the place . '' <newline> <newline> `` Well , I would say , why not ? I don ’ t want to be here . I hate this place too . '' <newline> <newline> `` Well , it hasn ’ t been as bad as it has been . I think we can finally try to make it work . I ’ m tired of it . '' <newline> <newline> `` It 's been horrible . Let me put it this way . Why were you mad one time when there wasn ’ t been any madness on your job ? We don ’ t know . But we ’ re gon na have to change . We ’ ve had enough madness that can n't be saved anymore , but we have to keep going . We ’ gonne get too far out of the ways of insanity and let the place die . '' <newline> <newline> `` Oh , I ’ m sorry . I ’ d like to be here . I ’ m sorry I ’ m here . '' <newline> <newline> `` You hate it like we hate it . I don ’ t like this place too . I think it is better , but let it die . '' <newline> <newline> `` Why not ? Well , I ’ m sorry I had to stop at that time. I ’ d enjoy staying here . But I don ’ t want to be here anymore . I just wish I could be here . '' <newline> <newline> `` You could have . It ’ s just a matter of moving on with your life and doing another job for a couple months , and then I ’ d be out of here . It wouldn ’ t be such a disaster , though . I 'll do my best to find that place that really works , and let you work there for a while until we can get this all figured out , and then if we can ’ t find it , I ’ m sure we can figure something out . I can ’ t even imagine that , you know ? It would be a shame to waste it on something so pointless .
