'' <newline> <newline> Her letter will tell her what she has done and her motives . <newline> <newline> We 'll find out exactly what she did , she can be a bit more direct then he says . He says things like `` She left all of my things , the car , and everything else in it , into a different place , I 'm sorry '' <newline> <newline> She may have a family or friends with her friends , maybe the ex of some type . <newline> <newline> He wo n't tell us her intentions , he wants to make sure we know all the things I 'm leaving our lives so they never get out here . <newline> <newline> Her final words to me are `` I 'll always be with you '' or `` I love you '' or some variation thereof . <newline> <newline> I 'm sorry .

You 've come to collect and your phone is dead . Describe what happened , what you collected . [ wp ] <|startoftext|> It was a dark day in Seattle . My feet were on tarmac , and I was out cold . I knew I should n't have come down alone . But I was determined to make it up the ladder before sundown . <newline> <newline> I heard a voice inside my head , `` Please , let me help you . '' It was my roommate . <newline> <newline> `` I 'm alone , '' I replied . <newline> <newline> He put a hand on my shoulder . `` I understand . '' I was starting to think there were a couple of good reasons . I still had a small apartment , so there was no need for much privacy . I could go for a smoke , but I could also bring my laptop to a friend 's house . That meant I would n't need to take the stairs down . <newline> <newline> Then he looked down at my phone , `` Well , I do n't know who you are . I could be a psychic or some random guy , because I 'm not a psychic . But I suppose if you help me figure out where I am in this mess , things just fall into place . '' <newline> <newline> I was stunned . I almost fainted . `` But ... '' I began to feel tears rolling down my face . <newline> <newline> `` I 'm not going to ask you again , '' he said , and he reached into his pocket and pulled out a small pack of cigarettes . `` But you want to know what I need to do .

I forgot about that . '' <newline> <newline> `` It 's alright , though , '' he said , and he threw the pack into his backpack . `` The job it takes you to go places was fun . I only made friends because . When you 'd ask other people for help , they 'd say they had better things to do , and I 'd always be a little lonely , so I 'd ask for companionship . Eventually , though , I started looking for people . Maybe a little more than just friends . '' <newline> <newline> I looked around , at the dozens of faces staring back at me . `` I feel like I really did the right thing . '' <newline> <newline> `` No , I mean it , '' he repeated . `` As a young teenager in college , you made the wrong choice . You did n't want to live a life of isolation when you could be helping other people . I was trying to make it up to you , to be like you 're younger brother . '' <newline> <newline> I nodded again . <newline> <newline> He looked down at me for a long while . `` I 'm sorry , '' he said . `` I 'll leave you out here . '' And he left me with a smile . <newline> <newline> I walked into the next apartment
