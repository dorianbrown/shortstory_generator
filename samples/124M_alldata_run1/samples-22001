-sick ? The thing is more powerful . It also *has* to deal with the consequences of its actions . <newline> <newline> I tried to look at the clock and it had already gone back ten minutes . I guess I should have seen the way that the world goes . <newline> <newline> This was the moment I felt the panic begin . The end of the universe began . <newline> <newline> I was n't ready for what I did . The world was going to end without a bang . My own death . My own suffering . The universe would eventually explode . As though it could n't decide it did n't want to die so it would continue . <newline> <newline> The last time it did decided to go through , in order to be at peace after all , I died for no reason of any kind . I felt my soul start to slip and when I got up , I noticed that the place had gone dark . <newline> <newline> I sat in my cabin , my hands at my heart . I was n't ready to give up . <newline> <newline> `` I 'm sorry , ma'am . '' I slowly spoke to my girlfriend , which was n't very comfortable . `` We 're sorry , but she was just killed. '' The woman could not even finish herself , in a way . <newline> <newline> `` What 's wrong ? '' she asked . <newline> <newline> `` A bunch of people killed her . All in the name of hate . Like , they thought she was going to kill herself . '' I looked at my phone . <newline> <newline> `` She was n't a bad person . She was just fucking in pain . You 're going to have to be fucking kidding me about this here . '' she began to pull on her dress again . <newline> <newline> `` I know that was bullshit . What we really did was love her . '' <newline> <newline> `` God , I never realized that love really could help you . But that 's not what makes you a person . '' <newline> <newline> `` Oh , yeah and that 's why I 'm in hell . I mean it 's the only place where I can get to Heaven after being crucified , I guess . '' <newline> <newline> `` I know you do n't . But I really do n't know where I 'm going with this . '' <newline> <newline> `` Okay . How can you make me go and be with someone who I could talk to , instead of with an angry god ? Like you could actually help me ? '' <newline> <newline> `` How long will it take for me to get to someone who has n't made me ? '' <newline> <newline> `` A long time . '' <newline> <newline> `` I 'd love to . '' <newline> <newline> `` It 's all because of you . '' <newline> <newline> `` I can help you even if I do n't want to go up there . '' <newline> <newline> `` Really ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Really . '' <newline> <newline> A dark cloud had settled over the hillside . The sun was starting to creep down and out of view . The world seemed to collapse in on itself , the ground seemed to shift and shift and shift . The whole world changed in front of you and then disappeared . <newline> <newline> I was about four miles up when I heard something . The world went black . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <|endoftext|>
[WP] You are a serial killer caught on camera and in real life . You were caught by a group of people who found the body of your latest victim . <|startoftext|> *This was the police 's final piece . I was released from prison after six fatal car crashes in six months and four attempts to be caught , all of which were investigated by the authorities . * It was only one of many cases before the government made public the murder of several children , who had been killed by their own father for a car crash . The last known serial killer that had killed the remaining children , as well as several others , was identified as my son Thomas . They say that for a week the boy had been living on in the town of San Francisco . They say that when the boy 's mother was discovered dead in a motel room with his sister and sister 's children , I knew immediately `` that this person was probably a friend . '' That 's just some of the things they tell me . * <newline> <new
