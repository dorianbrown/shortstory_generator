[WP] You and a couple of friends decide to do something you had been planning all afternoon . You bring a pizza into your room for me to eat and we do n't have anything better to do but wait for your pizza to arrive . It does n't come . I guess you have n't been busy lately . <|startoftext|> The pizza box had arrived in the early afternoon . My friends and I had been waiting until that morning to eat it . As excited as I was for the chance to make new friends and eat new things , I knew it 'd take a while to finish . Then I 'd have enough time to eat , or even worse get more sleep . I hoped for a few months . We had a bunch of supplies we had packed on our backs . I took a knife from the back pack , and the rest of my pack . My backpack went up the wall . <newline> <newline> We packed the pizza box into my backpack and the knife into my back pack . The rest of the pack was n't packed but I took the knife and started cutting some slices . I put the knife in the plastic cup like a bowl and made a sandwich with bread , cheese and bacon . There was a moment of silence when we ate while I took the bread from the bottle and began cutting the pizza with the knife . <newline> <newline> We were late . I tried to run outside and say I had some other stuff . I could n't talk and I tried to hide . But as soon as I knew I was n't alone . They caught me too the moment the cops came for me . `` He 's running after us ! He does n't take no for an answer ! Come out with your hands up ! '' <|endoftext|>
[WP] The Devil and Superman have lived at the same time and met eachother for eternity . After decades of fighting and trying to get along , the two see eachother many times over again ... but this time they 're fighting eachother instead of the Devil and Superman . <|startoftext|> God damnit , a man came up to the window , got out his wallet and started shuffling inside . <newline> <newline> “ Hey you , the hell do you mean , ” I said , holding it over my head like a sword . <newline> <newline> “ I do n't mean you either , the hell I am out of here , ” he said , holding the wallet up to show me it was definitely the coolest thing in the world . <newline> <newline> He kept shuffling in , and with each movement I could just feel something in the pit of my belly grow . <newline> <newline> “ So you the big guy , right ? ” I asked , pointing to the room behind him . <newline> <newline> “ Well , who are they , you say ? ” he asked , still shuffling in . <newline> <newline> I sighed , and gave him one of my best poker faces . <newline> <newline> “ I 'm your friend , friend . They 're in the area , and they 're here to see us . It 'll be fun . ” <newline> <newline> He shrugged , still moving around , then he let me show him the rest of the room . <newline> <newline> I went over to the window , and put the keys in and slid it opened over the sides , then I closed it completely . <newline> <newline> “ I 'm sorry , what was that then ? ” I asked after opening the door next to two people . <newline> <newline> “ A phone ” , he said , and he was out the window , running . <newline> <newline> I was still watching from the other side , so I looked up as the guy ran . I could see the man was getting faster as he ran through the field . <newline> <newline> We were there for hours before I came back . I got to the end of the field and walked in . <newline> <newline> “ Howdy , you there ? ” he was doing something . I put the keys back in the wallet then we started moving . Then he kept running , faster than what I could keep track of , so I stopped to catch him a couple , then I walked back
