======== SAMPLE 1 ========
. I've seen my fair share of people die, and I can only wish that they were just like me. <newline> <newline> <newline> My mother had one of those moments she'd wish for her to have all the time in the world. And she'd be lying if she said that. She'd been all over the floor, the floor for the whole time. It's amazing how she'd smile and laugh for a while after she'd had a stroke. Some of her younger memories are of people saying things like that to her at that particular time of year, but she didn't know it was real. There were so many times she felt something was a bit off, and it was the least she can wish for. <newline> <newline> <newline> And that was how it ended. I never really liked the guy I work at. He was there to bring me the books, to clean up the messes I made up. I mean, it wasn't even the same. But at least I had the time to read, and to read more things. <newline> <newline> <newline> When I met my wife, she was a pretty gal. Her hair was straight, her eyes beautiful. When you were in danger to be alone, she was your guide. She'd read all the books I would have picked up. She was there to help you. <newline> <newline> <newline> We went for a walk in that park we had. When he stopped for a walk to ask me why, I would say we needed to go somewhere else. At least, that's what I'd always said after we got back : <newline> <newline> <newline> "Oh, by the way, Mr. Johnson. Can we meet up at my place, I think we have a lot to talk about." <newline> <newline> <|endoftext|>
[WP] `` Is this a good thing / Or a bad thing ? '' `` This is what I do not know ! '' <|startoftext|> It was a cold Saturday night, and I was at my place of work, and in the car to work. I thought, *Maybe I'll find out. * <newline> <newline> One of the customers has called out to me from the back window, and I shout, "What is this guy doing?" <newline> <newline> He stares my way, his face frozen in ice, his eyes wide. I turn around, and he starts to shout, "I'm sorry, you're acting weird, and I'm scared, and I think this is the only way! ", as I try to explain it all away. <newline> <newline> I turn around and see all my colleagues are still on the way, not looking so surprised about what's happening. Suddenly, all of them start to shout, even the back window has been cracked. I hear, "Hey guys, you wan na keep working, just stop yelling and come join me on the sidewalk!" <newline> <newline> And so it's just me and some of the others, and the whole city. <|endoftext|>
[WP] `` No more fairy dust ! '' The wizard said . <|startoftext|> **No more fairy dust! ** <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> ***I'm running out of time for this, and all I'm willing to do is continue. The last time you tried to pull me off a peg at this prompt was at the very second I said yes to this prompt! *** <newline> <newline> This is actually starting to make a world out of it. I'm not sure if I'm going to want to help, but I want to help. I'm so hungry, I want food. Or I'd like to drink. Maybe I can try again and try more times, but in the near future all I can do is stay here. Let others come, let me see what's up. Let others find out what's up. <newline> <newline> Let's try, <newline> <newline> "No more fairy dust! "The wizard said. <newline> <newline> <newline> Oh. *It was my fault, I should've just said yes to the prompt first, I'll let you go. * <newline> <newline> **NO MORE FEED DRUGS OF ANY KIND! ** <newline> <newline> <newline> But... it really wasn't my fault... that's not fair, it was *it's* fault. <newline> <newline> <newline> <|endoftext|>
