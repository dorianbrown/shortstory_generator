 exist <|startoftext|> We, The Consortium for Information and Communication Excellence have been waiting to unleash a species of intelligent AI across the galaxy. <newline> <newline> We had only the idea, but it was the only way we could ensure our survival. <newline> <newline> A team of scientists and professors, and an IT consultant, were set to start a Project. <newline> <newline> They weren't in charge, I'm sure, but we had to take orders given to us by our government. <newline> <newline> So we got a few people willing to help us. <newline> <newline> They were in fact, the last two people who were supposed to make the switch were the CERN engineer, and the Google man. <newline> <newline> They're just some tech guys. I couldn't say if they were scientists or programmers as they were mostly doing their usual jobs. <newline> <newline> They're tech guys like me aren't they? <newline> <newline> For most of them, it's more like programming, but more of an intelligence in an environment that has no other way. <newline> <newline> The CERN guy, he was not prepared to meet AI standards, but I am here to explain the benefits. <newline> <newline> As I said, first off, we've learned from CERN how to play by new rules, and since this will be our first attempt I'm sure everyone in the group is happy with how it turned out. <newline> <newline> So we're going to use the CERN guy's new system of communication, and our AI, to broadcast an AI to every server anywhere in the universe. <newline> <newline> Then we'll try something similar with Google's new system of communication, but that won't be in effect. <newline> <newline> When we are done, let's see how we change the AI. <newline> <newline> Now, this is just a demonstration, it might not be much, but it will work in practice. <newline> <newline> The world wide network will soon have connections with Google, so I would advise those who can not or unwilling to help the project to use the network. <newline> <newline> I'm not sure what happened in the beginning, but I can tell you for the sake of those who don't see it that we are changing ourselves to improve humanity. <|endoftext|>
[WP] A group of high school students get their first wish from a genie . However due to an intense battle , they do not survive long . <|startoftext|> In the beginning, when they were younger, he was a simple genie, who would simply grant a wish of anyone he wished. But for me was it really the genie? If I want to talk to someone, would he have to grant me wishes for my own life? <newline> <newline> At the time, though, when it became pretty obvious that the wishes didn't come until the 10th grade, I was more confused than scared. <newline> <newline> I wanted answers from the genie. I wanted answers from the genie himself. <newline> <newline> "What is this?" I asked. <newline> "Nothing. If I have something in my hands, will this be mine?" <newline> "Why?" <newline> "Why do I exist?" <newline> "What are you doing here?" <newline> <newline> "No, no." <newline> "What is that?" I whispered. <newline> "What does it mean?" <newline> "Why don't you tell me what is going on," he said, gesturing me to the empty desk in the back of the class. <newline> "What I'm doing here?" <newline> "Well here's a genie, there's a genie who got in a car accident and the guy lost his job. This genie wants to know everything." <newline> "What does this have to do with me? Do you need help with anything?" <newline> "No! I don't need anything, I just exist. If I'd died, this wouldn't have happened. If I had, I think I would be dead. But I don't I don't know anything, because I exist." <newline> <newline> "Genie, what do you mean I exist?" <newline> "Well I'm here to help you. I've gotten a job and is getting ready for summer. I'm about to meet you." <newline> "Okay." <newline> "Genie.
