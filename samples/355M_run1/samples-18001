======== SAMPLE 1 ========
isted that 's what they called me . <newline> <newline> We never spoke a word to each other , at least until the day I met the doctor . On the day he explained it to me . <newline> <newline> `` So , when I was born I was given this power that granted me the ability to control my own future . I am not very good with my tools so they made me go to the clinic and ask for help . After that , everything became more and more uncertain . Everyone , from me , felt like my fate was decided . No matter how careful I was , I could n't make a single single move . '' <newline> <newline> The doctor said this with that same solemn expression of seriousness and solemnity that he 'd displayed on every day . I could finally take it . I could finally live my life . <newline> <newline> But I was not happy with the outcome of the experiment . I was the one who chose to try and take the experiment , and I knew it would n't work . <|endoftext|>
[WP] Tell me why you hate the world . <|startoftext|> 'Is it a good place to be ? ' I asked myself , staring directly into the camera lens . 'I 'd say so . ' I 'd be honest if I should be , it 's still a hell of a life . I had seen a lot of bad things over the years as a kid . I 'd even visited a lot of hell for this , but my first ever visit since it 's like this was the most important thing I ever told myself . <newline> <newline> In his face , I was like a cat on my belly , looking at myself . I should be the asshole , the guy who got away with doing so , while he just pretended to be an asshole . I should have been in some sort of high school punk rock album for years , while he still pretended to be the most important person to have ever lived . And I would have been the shit where he was n't , like how I always wanted I was , which , now , might not 've been true , if I were to think of it . It might have been . <newline> <newline> He had n't come all out of this , of course , I had n't been given the chance at being the one who went out . I had n't even been given the opportunity to be the one who told himself , `` No , sorry , I 'm so tired right now , I can hardly keep my mind off of some guy with a camera phone and this thing to tell people to make fun of when they get themselves into a real mess . '' <newline> <newline> In his view , I was a dumbass , so I was . <newline> <newline> He would try to tell me that I looked cute , or cute enough to compliment , or even help get a better camera phone . He had my eyes , but he was n't sure how to tell the camera and the camera that , hey , why the hell did you stop working ? This is n't my fault , I 'm a dumbass . <newline> <newline> There was this one thing that happened while we were sitting down in the bus . The bus , in fact , had the first stop at the end of every day of the year . I hated that man , he sat on my lap , as always , and started looking at me for a picture . <newline> <newline> `` I 've had enough , '' I said , while he stared at me through the camera lens . He started getting annoyed , he 'd only tried to help me out once before , so if he only got some sort of help this time , he knew that he would be the one sitting in front of the camera . <newline> <newline> `` What ? '' he asked , getting annoyed . <newline> <newline> `` This bus man . He is some sort of creep that was n't meant for me just the other day . He just sits around at home without my help . I should have never gotten onto the bus , I should have never paid my bus ticket to get here . <newline> <newline> `` What 's his name ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Michael Cavanaugh , probably . '' <newline> <newline> `` It 's not his name ! '' <newline> <newline> `` I was going to ask him for my name , my name . '' <newline> <newline> `` You knew my name was n't my name , how did you know that ? '' <newline> <newline> `` It just felt natural . '' <newline> <newline> `` Why would I leave , you know the story
