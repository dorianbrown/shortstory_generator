 to a new game from a new developer . <|startoftext|> I love making games like that . And , I am also passionate , creative and incredibly talented in all of the fields that come naturally to me ... so that must mean I 'm capable of making these games . <newline> <newline> My background is in graphic design and computer programming but , I 've always been a storyteller . I got my first piece of text in elementary school , and it did n't work out great . I went to college , and have been making interactive movies and games since I was eleven . But , I still have one , small game that 's stuck with me since I was eight . It 's a story about people 's feelings about the death of their parents and the life they lead . So , I thought I 'd share it with you . <|endoftext|>

'' <|startoftext|> I had been falling for hours , and I had lost a lot of blood - and my sanity , I could n't even speak any words . Finally , I had reached my destination . I reached the bottom . I knew what would come . <newline> <newline> I heard a loud thud echo from the far side of my cave , which I knew was a small cave that the villagers in that nearby town had been using as an escape . Now it was all the villagers that had been fighting to escape - the cave was too small for their supplies . <newline> <newline> I was already here . They would not stop me . *It was* the end of the world , I was told by those that lived nearby that it would be an easy escape for them . <newline> <newline> I reached to my side and took out my binoculars , examining my surroundings . It was a small town . I had come a long way , they probably could have used a few of them before they had lost all their strength to me . <newline> <newline> Then I saw them . They were looking for supplies - for food - for clothing . They were all looking for me . <newline> <newline> `` I 've made it to my destination , now , '' I said , dropping the binocular . I turned and walked home , heading towards my home . My friends were all sitting on the couch , watching a movie . I was waiting for them when they returned with more supplies . <newline> <newline> *In this movie , you 're an assassin* , I thought to myself as I was watched by my friends and family all the way home . <newline> <newline> [ WARNING : SPOILERS FOR MOTHER INCLUDE , IF YOU DO NOT KNOW OR DO NOT WANT TO SEE , PLEASE REMEMBER TO CLOSE THINGS . ] <|endoftext|>
