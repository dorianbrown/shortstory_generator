 with a smile , “ I ’ ll be back in a ‘ dank ’ and make me a joke ’ . I don ’ t care about a joke because a joke would be a joke . I don ’ t care about the jokes . This is my life , the life before my death . You wouldn ’ t believe it , if you didn ’ t live in the moment . I ’ ve always gone to a moment in a movie or a novel and I ’ ve never gone there . I ’ ve never been there . I ’ ll stay here with you , and the universe . It ’ s like a movie , but in the future it ’ s like a movie . I don ’ t care if I ’ m dead or not . No . I ’ m going to be remembered for the time in which I die , for the time when I ’ m ready . You ’ ve made this movie , I ’ ve made this universe . I ’ ve made this cosmos . <newline> <newline> “ We ’ ll know where you went in life. ” <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <|endoftext|>
[WP] Scientists have found , using a computer simulation , that the universe was created out of thin air . However , all other realities are completely shattered . <|startoftext|> This experiment is the first one we have done that we can do with all hands ! I was going to publish this one yesterday but we went ahead and the last one had been done before I knew the research ! <newline> It 's a simulation so there is the possibility for things to collapse , for example you can break the laws of nature because we know that it will make it happen and we need to figure out what is the limit . This simulation is the first in which there was a break in the laws . <newline> <newline> And this simulation is the first simulation we have ever made . So we have to figure out how to make the simulation and that way in 10 minutes and no more and the whole universe is just an empty space . <newline> It is now just a simulation that is now just a simulation . <newline> <|endoftext|>
[WP] You die and realize your entire life was going to be a VR game . After all these years and all the weird ... things you 've done , all this thinking and all the things you forgot ... <|startoftext|> I do n't think that I ever went through life as a human being . I think I 'm just a little bit more lonely than this man I met . They said it 's not my fault , I 'm so lonely . It was just a way to feel at ease . <newline> <newline> It was all because he took out a bottle of liquor and got drunk . I did n't want the liquor to have any effect when the whiskey started to burn the skin off his hand ; all the skin around it began to feel like skin , but then he left it off . I do n't know what he did there . He started taking a few shots of whiskey , and I took those shots with him . I had never seen so many shots before . There was a guy in front of me who was just smoking the stuff , and I do n't remember any other time . It was pretty quiet , but I guess . <newline> <newline> I woke up in a strange place and found myself in this strange place . I did n't recognize anything about myself . There was an empty space over there , like a giant hole in the wall and I was in a small room . There was a man . Just lying there , with his right hand still where he still sits . He just keeps smoking . <newline> <newline> `` I told you to quit . '' I said in my confused voice in the corner . `` Quit smoking . '' <newline> <newline> `` You know I did n't quit ? '' He replies . <newline> <newline> `` Do n't you forget that . '' I said . `` I 'm sure that you remember that you made a mistake . '' I say . <newline> He laughs . I laugh a little too . <newline> <newline> `` Well ... I do n't know . '' He says . <newline> <newline> `` What 's that in your mouth ? You ca n't taste anything . '' I ask . <newline> He laughs again , and it 's like he does n't think I 'm joking on me . Oh my god he still has his mouth . <newline> <newline> `` I ca n't taste anything . '' I growl . <newline> <new
