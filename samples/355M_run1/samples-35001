 fill the bowl and eat it . After this was done , I asked the priest for another pair of pews and a table and a chair . My friends had already packed , but I chose not to be the last , so I was happy with being the person who got the table and chair . I looked over to my friend and said , `` Are n't you gon na buy any more watermelon ? '' he asked . I 'd already gone and bought one last time and had enough of them . I got up and walked over to the sink to get another pair of watermelon and had a glass as I went back to my apartment . <|endoftext|>
[WP] You are a young man who has just learned that you are going to be the protagonist in a series of popular video game series . <|startoftext|> There I was , standing in a white room , eyes on my phone , staring at the wall . I was a kid with good looks and an appetite , and this was going to be easy . <newline> <newline> `` Hey Kyle . '' I said as I got up and started walking towards Kyle 's room . <newline> <newline> `` Hey mommy , '' he said in his best 'Hey mommy ' style , `` you ok ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Y-y-yes , little man . '' <newline> <newline> `` So did Dad when you were a kid . '' Kyle said looking back at them both . Then he turned and turned back again as if to change the subject . <newline> <newline> `` Sorry to burst your mood , '' I said and I turned up my voice . After all , it was about to end . <newline> <newline> I looked down at where my mother lay on her bed . She had an open face , not an issue , because I do n't think we 've ever had the occasion . She 'd always been an optimist , which has earned her a little frown in recent years . Her hair was brown and curly with a deep red sheen at the temples . Kyle nodded at me , the words making it difficult for him to hold it . <newline> <newline> `` You still like me ? '' <newline> <newline> `` No , '' I replied . <newline> <newline> `` Ok , '' Kyle started . `` I 'm not gon na stop loving you ! '' <newline> <newline> Then I remembered that he had a pretty good shot of it . The little jock who tried and failed to get the girls at the table . Now I 'm all in with him . <newline> <newline> Then it happened . He turned the gun off and shot myself in the head , and his body fell down at the bottom . <newline> <newline> This was going to end quick at any rate . I needed to calm back down , but I could n't control myself . <newline> <newline> I felt something hit me over the head . And then another . I was falling as fast as I could , but I could n't catch myself . I fell to the ground and held back tears . My mommy and my father 's faces kept looking at me . I could n't take it . Finally , I stood up and looked at all of my friends . I could n't take it . They looked at me with blank faces . <newline> <newline> `` Are you alright mommy ? '' They said . <newline> <newline> `` Yes ! '' I said in tears , `` I just need a few minutes . Have a very good day , Dad . '' <newline> <newline> `` Aww ! '' <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <|endoftext|>
[WP] A day in the life of a slave . <|startoftext|> `` How long has she been here ? '' one of the guards asked . <newline> <newline> I could feel him watching my every move . He knew that this was how he would see it . I had been here for two and a half years , and my days were numbered . He had to know . <newline> <newline> He continued , `` I just want her to have another day , I ca n't wait to see her again . '' <newline> <newline> He was right , I did n't know if she would make it . <newline> <newline> Two hours have passed . She had woken up early because of the work . When she awoke , she had missed her meal . Her guard stood at the edge of her bed , watching her . She made a face , and gave him a nod before he walked back to his post . <newline
