 the time , but no time to explain . <newline> <newline> I 'm stuck here , alone , and so I will keep my mouth shut . I 'll let someone else deal with it . There 's a few years of my lifespan I 've spent living in this car . I 'll have someone tell me . I 'll let them know what I 've done . I 'll feel ashamed and pity myself and the people who I 've forced myself to talk to or pity myself for it . There 's days of my life where I 've found comfort in that . I 'm not scared . I 'm just disappointed in being trapped and forced into existence . I am but one person , I 've been given the responsibility of millions of people , and it 's not enough . I 've only had one job , and it was only done because I could . But still , I know that this universe has n't given me the opportunity , it does n't allow me to make progress because of people like me , even now . <newline> <newline> I 'm not even sure where I 'm going . If I 'm to die , I 'm not going on an island or on a secluded island , you just assume that way , because that seems as if death is n't possible to bear . So I 'll just hang on to as long as I can . It can be any place I can think of , I know it 's true . But if I am to die I have to move on , somewhere else . I 'm stuck here , without the comfort of others , knowing that I 'm going to get out of this one way or that other way too . I had it all wrong , it 's not good for my peace of mind , the world is n't going to give me much peace of mind . I want peace of mind . <newline> <newline> I 'm not sure I believe in life after dying . I have n't seen anyone or anything for months , my mind is kind of numb . It 's not a long cycle , I only have until my brain finally does anything at all , until it stops thinking . <newline> <newline> I 'm so afraid of death . When my brain finally moves on , I do n't understand how I got here , I thought I was ready for death . It 's such a terrible shame I ended up here . When they finally tell me that my brain is finally gone , I feel relieved . It seems like death is a blessing in my life . A blessing that I ca n't say farewell to . A blessing that I would n't ever know . A blessing I ca n't say farewell to , before I start my eternal journey . I do n't want to die , if I am to die , I wo n't . But here I am , sitting at the top of the world , feeling satisfied with the life I 've had . I ca n't say goodbye for anything , but I think I 'll just hang on there for a while . Hang on . Just let me die before I end this day . I do n't want to die , but I have n't got a choice . I do n't want to let go , but I 'm so afraid of dying . <newline> <newline> That 's the first day of my twenty-second year of life . I wake up , and I know one day I 'll just stand up , be able to look up and know how long I 've wasted , and what have I come here for . And I never would 've let that happen . I was ready to die , I was ready to die . Now my hand 's in the air , and the world is already spinning and I know I 've no where to look . I do n't know if I 'll die of age , or if I 'll never die and never feel anything again , but I 'll try . I 've been able to get through this time and I 'm finally close . I 'm close with all living things , I 'm close with myself . <newline> <newline> I 'm ready to begin today 's task once again . <|endoftext|>
[WP] A man is sitting in a park behind a lake . He takes a sip of water and sighs deeply ... as he 's lost his mind . <|startoftext|> I always see them staring at me all day and I ca n't help but feel they want me to get up , to look in my reflection and feel ashamed . I always tell them how I can never take a joke , only they 'll laugh . This is a beautiful , quiet , beautiful place , the park and me are making everything my life felt like I need nothing . I can feel the grass under my feet as the leaves rustle . In a couple
