 called for an emergency , the lights dimmed , and I fell . <newline> <newline> I felt a pain . <newline> <newline> Then I felt something solid beneath me . I looked in my eye and saw I hit my head . I looked in my eye again and another thing grabbed my arms , pulled my legs against me and then crushed me in one big swallow . The things was growing larger and bigger in size as they neared my torso . There were more of them out there . <newline> <newline> As I fell , I realized my mother was too scared to tell me what I did to her because she was so scared of what was happening . I knew what was happening to her . The thing in my arm , holding me , said something I could n't hear . <newline> <newline> The lights flickered . I looked in my eye and saw I was in the arms of the things in front of me now , and they looked around . Then the lights went to all sorts of directions and directions not in the normal way , and a light at one was a hole I had n't noticed before . I picked it up , and looked at the light . I saw it was n't a hole , but something bigger . There were more of them out there too . They were looking at me , as if trying to figure out what to think about my situation . There was a dark darkness where I was sitting . <newline> <newline> I looked outside my window . There was darkness everywhere . They looked so very familiar . I looked up at my mother . <newline> <newline> ''Mommy , why am I in front of you ? '' <newline> <newline> Her head tilted down to the floor , in an attempt of a smile . <newline> <newline> The lights flickered . I saw them all being smaller and smaller , and then , in a split second of my mother â€™ s eyes , they were being put smaller and smaller to look just like me . Then their faces changed , and one of them was a baby . Then my girlfriend . Then my father . <newline> <newline> They were not smaller than me . <newline> <newline> Then they were smaller , and they changed shape . <newline> <|endoftext|>
[WP] Every time anyone says `` my dad will robot death , '' it is a direct counter to the phrase `` i will find my dad '' . <|startoftext|> `` Well shit . '' <newline> <newline> `` My dad will robot death , right ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Correct ! '' <newline> <newline> `` Do n't get me wrong , it 's great for a guy like you , but for me a robot death is just an overcomplicated sentence that does not say 'a robot death ' , not in that order either . '' <newline> <newline> `` ... '' <newline> <newline> `` Why the fuck is he not here ? '' <newline> <newline> `` He 's gone . '' <newline> <newline> `` He 's not here ? '' <newline> <newline> `` His father , the one person you would call his 'dad ' . He used to be the best programmer of all his friends . He was the one that made the first successful AI and created a whole universe of robots for cheap money . He was brilliant , but not a great genius . And then he said that his dad will robot death , right now , because we live in a future where robots are still being developed for the first time - '' <newline> <newline> `` ... '' <newline> <newline> `` I 'm just saying ... '' <newline> <newline> `` No not literally , it really is hard to believe , what if people did actually think him dead long before he made his first AI . Would you believe me if I said that ? '' <newline> <newline> `` ... '' <newline> <newline> `` Well yeah , but what if I told you that it was n't actually impossible to become a robot or a living being ? What if we were in our twenties or thirties ? '' <newline> <newline> `` I 'm sorry , but could we really be that clear ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Well yeah , but you would n't get that . In fact , in that moment , I 've seen the entirety of every single technological advancement in the universe , and even then , they had to change their tech to that of a mechanical construct . It was a hard situation , to say the least - people were still in the loop for a while , when they would get a lot of things
