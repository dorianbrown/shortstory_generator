 was the same as you , but you 're not really ready to play with us. You 're not ready to play with our friends . As much as we like you , your love . I know you could have done a different thing . You have a strong personality with an infectious personality and if I told you to take a life , you would do the same . But as long as someone can kill their own parents , that 's all you have to do . That 's the way I always wanted to be . You are the way I wish you would be . But that is not so . I am not ready to kill myself . I 'll be the man you love . <|endoftext|>
[WP] After a long battle , he wins . <|startoftext|> We fought one long time ago . I never know what happened , but I remember the first time we fought . This time the people of the wasteland were all gone , leaving this planet . We were all here in an isolated place . We fought and it was over . And after a long battle , it ended . <newline> <newline> It was the last time the people were in this planet , no more than a hundred thousand years and they were all gone . As soon as we returned from it all our power faded away and we now lay on the lifeless planet laying in a desert . <newline> <newline> In the following years we did not want to move again : we never wanted to be here . If we were moving again , then why were we fighting it all and not moving , with him being no longer in the same place ? I am glad the sun is gone . God . I want to say goodbye , but he has n't heard , but he is dead . I think I must be alive to leave this place . <newline> <newline> Oh , I know that this would be an emotional place . I would love to leave it , not because it would be so easy , but because it would be . <|endoftext|>
[WP] In a time of infinite optimism the only way out of these times is for a small boy , to do a thing ( e.g. ) <|startoftext|> It was a rainy day of the year , as usual , I just had to brush my teeth . I had just finished brushing my teeth in the morning and was going back out in the yard . <newline> <newline> *Door ! * I was in the yard looking out at the sky , when suddenly there was a flash . I did n't know what it was but I remember it the moment my father dropped his pack on me on the way back home from the store . I had just picked up the pack , and when I saw it , that my father had dropped it on me was ... a little unnerving . I thought what if it was a monster , so I opened my mouth when my mouth was open and just watched it . <newline> <newline> When it hit me , I said to myself , it was a monster . <|endoftext|>
[WP] You have awoken to your new roommate and all hell breaks , and your only option is love : <|startoftext|> I am happy . <newline> <newline> It was only a little while later , after a brief meeting with my new roommate , the realization dawning upon my mind that I was truly the perfect boyfriend . If only that were n't true . I hated that moment ! I should n't have been so selfish , but it worked out . And I wanted better times with my new friend . <newline> <newline> When I woke up the next morning , I saw him on the living room TV , with my new roommate . He asked me what I wanted to talk about with him , and I told him I wanted to say some things about him . He then pointed to me in a really bad way , and said , `` I want to see yours . '' <newline> <newline> When I told him that there would be only one thing that I wanted to say , he just looked at me and gave a dumb grin and shook his head . <newline> <newline> I think this is really weird . It 's like one of those sweet , happy time stories the other end is a real story , with my new roommate really liking me . But in a good way ! <newline> <newline> This was only yesterday , so ... nothing special . But now ... i 'm going to call in my new roommate and get him to write me an entry saying `` I love you . Do n't worry about anything else . Just take care of yourself . '' <|endoftext|>
[WP] As you walk out of the grocery store , you notice there was a $ 5 bottle still sitting above the counter . A small bag . <
