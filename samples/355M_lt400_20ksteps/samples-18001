======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 children , with their smiles and laughs . All the things that could be found beautiful in a beautiful world fell to the ground . To find happiness in someone else 's world was impossible . To stand idly in a world of imperfections was cruel and mean . I never once dreamed of the happiness that I felt in the world , only a cold and boring indifference . Every morning I sat in bed , contemplating of a life I never wanted . I wanted to be an artist , but I 've never made it in life . I was n't lucky enough to have the highest grade of intelligence possible , or at least the lowest grade I could find . For that I was condemned to this life , all I wanted was to be miserable . But I did not want to live in this world at all . I went up and asked for a divorce . But to me , I was a stupidass bitch . So I did this , I tried to find happiness as quickly as possible , I tried to see the world through new eyes and try to change something in it . But I never did . And so the only reason I lived in this world , is because I did n't . And I was too selfish and self absorbed to attempt happiness here . And that 's why I 'm leaving . <newline> <newline> <newline> And that 's why I 'm still here . But I do n't talk to other souls , I 'm not around . I do n't want to be seen . I 'm not really an angel . I 'm just a human , I live my life in this world , not in this one . I can see my reflection in the reflection of people I had the same emotions for , every day . I see love , and I can see a world . I see everything , not just what I wanted . But I 'm so damn happy . Godspeed and Godspeed ... <|endoftext|>
[WP] The final battle of a war between good and evil ... Is won by the latter . <|startoftext|> All I ever felt was peace between the two , the two people I never thought I would love best . The first being my husband . He is the man I had to kill for a single woman ; that was a man . `` No no , I have to get her '' , my wife smiled at me , and pulled out the gun , she was as beautiful and innocent as the sun shone . I had nothing that could stop that smile she was smiling . <newline> <newline> The day the two of them had to die , I knew I could not let it happen . I always thought I would see them again . I tried to talk them out of it , and tried my best I tried my best . The bullets that hit me where my heart should have stayed were just to much to take , I could feel the bullets in my wife 's body . There was no pain in the whole world . I was just lucky , I had the man of my dreams in me . <newline> <newline> I sat at my desk , waiting and watching with some interest his name was James . He was an old man , with old glasses and a gray beard . They never stopped smiling , they never looked me in the eye . I watched him for a while , thinking he had been in his prime in life , I finally saw it . <newline> <newline> `` Damn thing . They were still smiling . '' He said when my wife stopped shooting him . He had been dead for a while and I heard the man of her eyes , `` Well its time for the funeral , you better prepare the staff . '' <|endoftext|>
No one expected them . No one in history expected anything . <|startoftext|> `` The fuck ! '' he shouted . `` You can have me ! '' <newline> The boy , not even five minutes older then himself , leaned in close and grabbed his friend . They stared each other down , and each one gave her time . <newline> <newline> They sat at their table in the bar where they 'd had such a talk and laugh . He 'd given her a drink in return , and he was laughing too , having the best drink the bar had to offer him . He seemed to really enjoy what she did , and that brought a smile to their faces . <newline> <newline> Then they heard a knock on their door . They were all out , except him , and they let themselves in , and found it strange . <newline> <newline> *Why is he so quiet ? * asked his friend . <newline> <newline> The two looked around . All over , was what looked like their roommate , the mother , who lived in a trailer and never had much . Her car was there . His apartment was there to be found . The door was still open . His bed was in bed in the kitchen
