'' <newline> <newline> <newline> The President looked at John . <newline> <newline> <newline> `` Yes , I can see why . But we need to take action .

You , the human , learn this as a child , during a period of imminent natural disaster . <|startoftext|> It was the morning , after I had finished with lunch after school , I was a wee bit bored with it . We get the news all the time on Monday morning . The day before that , I was at work , and the day before that , we saw a blackout or whatever it was . <newline> <newline> So at 7pm , I had just finished dinner and had it with two cups of tea in hand when I heard the alarm . As I opened the door it was dark and my eyes were adjusting to the darkened room . I heard my alarm going off . *Worry* , I was told again . <newline> <newline> It was 9pm , I was too tired , so I went straight to bed . As I was still in bed , it 's still very dark in my bedroom since my mum had already left for work . I went to go to work that night , but in my sleep I saw a flash . I went to the window .
