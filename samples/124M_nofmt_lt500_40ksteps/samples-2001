[WP] A human is stranded in a small town in the 20th century , but no one knows if they are alone . <|startoftext|> The town was the place I first made the journey to. There was no town in the world besides that of the nearby village of Davenport. I had been lost that day, my only survivor before a sudden sudden stop on a new day. It must have been a bad plan to kill anyone in existence and save my little girl ; I had to kill everyone else, for sure. And there was nothing stopping my mother from forcing her daughter, this being I had to save, to come here in one piece and take me home to her. I wasn't sure if I would be safe, for it was very quiet and I was alone. The only reason I was home was because I was about to kill all those around me anyway so they would only be there so they could stop me. I would have had my cake, of course, but I'd just had the heart to kill everyone, so why bother? <newline> <newline> I arrived to find that my face was completely obscured by smoke and the smells of death. In front of me lay a large pile of corpses that seemed to have fallen from the sky. I hadn't expected to see the corpses in their bodies, but the smell of death was definitely there. My mother had given me a box for that was pretty much the best thing I had, but the way death was so obvious it made it difficult for me to think. I couldn't just leave my corpse outside and go back to bed. I woke up, feeling like a mess, with only enough time on my hands to get a second dose of the medicine to help me focus, but no matter how much I put in I couldn't get a breath. <newline> <newline> It took a bit to get to the hospital, but the doctors there said that I had to stay for a medical treatment too, which is why I would probably lose my baby. They said it would only take 3 weeks to get there, that it was quite a strange time. I had the hope of finding another wife. But, no matter how I tried I couldn't find her. I was going to die soon. At least with my new wife I would soon have to look after my sick mother. The other days were better, I could sleep for once. The first time she saw me, she was so proud, she seemed to be crying. Then, no matter how hard I tried she wouldn't have listened to me, she always wanted to live. That wasn't why I was crying. I could see her tears growing and she would try to calm her, but only in a way that I couldn't hear. Finally, I was going to die. I would live, I would grow and die and live, I would fight till death and survive till my son died on the other side. At least then I would be alone and not know where I was and no one would know I was. No one would have known. <newline> <newline> <|endoftext|>
