In his hideout , a gun tells you nothing is ever going to be okay again . And you 're pretty sure it 's a gun . <|startoftext|> I felt numb as I pulled the trigger of my gun , my body shook with the vibrations of the gun and the recoil of the firearm . I knew at this point I could either fight or flee ; I had nothing to fear so I did neither , however my body was tired and I could n't think at this time of day , I had to think at the moment , '' Do n't fuck with a gun ! You just got shot ! '' and I did . I knew that if I ran , I would leave no trace of me leaving , or of any person . To me , an automatic gun like this would seem like a nightmare , I wanted to leave my house early and go to work , I just could n't do that . This day , I found that I was still tired , I was n't in my bedroom or on the floor , my only comfort was in the gun in my hands , it was reassuring to see that there was n't another human in it . I did n't have another motive for it , I just wanted it to stop with my gun , and not to kill me . I would n't have it . I would n't be the man I am today , I hate myself for taking this gun and I wanted to die . <newline> `` Damn them '' I said to myself . <|endoftext|>

[WP] You come back from the dead and find yourself in the comic book universe . You 're not old or anything , you just turned-up in a comic and some old dude is telling you to save the books . <|startoftext|> The last thing I remember was a man telling me to stop talking to my cat . I guess you could say I just found myself in a different world ... <newline> All the way into the middle of my breakfast as I was walking through the door of my small local coffee shop I saw the old man that was standing just for those few seconds that the sun was on . The place I was just standing there for just the briefest of moments at the breakfast stand before the man came in and sat down in front of me . `` Morning coffee , '' he asked , smiling slightly when he told me I could come get more coffee . I was a bit startled at his smile until I looked up and asked , `` What you wish ? '' . He looked down , with a look of confusion and then back up . `` I , I do n't know where to . I am just ...
