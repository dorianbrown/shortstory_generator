[WP] The apocalypse has occurred . It 's much worse than you would think . It 's actually a lot worse than what you expected . <|startoftext|> When I woke up in the middle of the ocean , I did n't know when it finally happened . I did n't have the capability to comprehend what was happening , so I only assumed the first thing I remember about it was the sun exploding , and how warm the air felt , and the wind blowing down the street into the air . <newline> <newline> At first it felt like something was going on , like some bad earthquake or other , but now I was used to it . I felt that anything I breathed into any environment would have killed me , and every single breath of air I breathed would have killed me , and every single minute of it would have killed me . I wanted to be dead , I wanted to fall off a cliff edge , or die in a car accident , but I figured that was n't a great option . Any time I fell off a cliff I knew I was on point , but that did n't stop me from falling out of that cliff ledge at the last second , and I was going to end up back in hell . I would n't make it out alive and eventually come to , but soon every death I 'd bring back would be just another kill . The first of the new arrivals arrived , and he made a quick gesture that he would be spared for his own sake , and soon I found myself with the only person that I 'd ever had the misfortune of needing to know about . I was n't sure what he meant , but he looked at me like I was crazy for even asking his name , and I could n't look away from how I felt about him . <newline> <newline> My friend was out here with all his family , but he 'd heard that those people were here , and he would eventually get back on his feet . When people in this time of need were being killed , I decided to help him . I bought up and upgraded my radio station , and I was on the road to my old house . The first thing I needed was some basic supplies , and I got there almost ready to run off a cliff . In the first few days there were an overwhelming horde of people , and I needed some more food . I went up to the house and found a pile of cardboard , enough to last me for a week , then the neighbors found me , and took me back , but this time I was scared . I wanted it back , but I had no idea how to get to heaven , and I 'd had plenty of times where I 'd gotten out of here in my mind . I could n't stand this any longer . I went back up the mountain , and found a cabin , and I found it was a real estate estate agent , and I asked for one of the top ten agents to go with me , and she agreed . She said her agent was God , that he has a power beyond any I 've ever had before , and it was going to make him rich , so I could get my soul back again , and it was working out for me even though it might be a hell of a trip , but at the time that was n't so bad . <newline> <newline> I 'd been waiting for a while , to get home , to get away with something , really something , that did n't sound so bad to think about . As I was getting to the last of the supplies , I looked at my GPS , and everything was getting brighter and colder , and the sky was getting higher and darker , but I could n't be there . A few seconds later I saw a light fade away over the woods , and then it looked so bright the whole sky was black as ever . I was almost back again , and this was going to be a good time for it . <|endoftext|>

Every single waking , breathing , breathing thing around you dies off , leaving you with just a brain . <|startoftext|> I could feel a heartbeat , a rhythm of a heartbeat . <newline> <newline> I 'm not talking about a heartbeat . I 'm talking about this tiny little thing in my chest , and it never gets any louder nor will it ever stop . <newline> <newline> I 've been here and done here .
