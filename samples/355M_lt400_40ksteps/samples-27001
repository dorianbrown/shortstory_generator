======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 one time . <|startoftext|> I am the last human on Earth , and the final resting place of a long forgotten civilization ( maybe the first or so ) . It has become a bit overpopulated , and I see a few friends and coworkers as I sit , with their lunch and a cup of coffee that they enjoy , and have passed on . The buildings up on the outskirts have been razed , and the people who are sitting now , like me , have no home , but we all remember the past and have a place , the same as us . <newline> <newline> I look across the landscape at the landscape that was once the center of the Earth . I am the last human on Earth , and the last remaining human on Earth . It has become a bit overpopulated . So , I look over at the landscape , still full of people , sitting , like me . We all do , on this very day . And then it happens . The sky , full of angels . One with a gun , and he pulls the trigger , and all of the angels are gone . <|endoftext|>
[WP] You get superpowers when you are a person . One day after coming out , your dad says to you , `` Son , you have become the most powerful human being . Now what is the most interesting fact you become aware of ? '' <|startoftext|> It was a pretty simple question ... I had become the most powerful human being in the world ? <newline> <newline> Now there was a huge , confusing debate to be had , but it 's a simple one ; what the most interesting thing one of us develops is how they develop this 'something ' , and what develops it , and what they use it for . <newline> <newline> 'Hmm , ' I pondered , 'it was ... something to do with ... *this* . ' I had already seen where this argument started . The answer was pretty clear : the most interesting thing someone develops is how they develop this new thing , how they develop it , etc . <newline> <newline> How are these things related ? Of course . There were a few other variables , but I could still see where this argument originated : humans never develop anything beyond curiosity until they have learned things . <newline> <newline> My parents had been the first to notice , and as it turns out , it was surprisingly easy to recognize what I was developing as 'something ' ... <newline> <newline> ' ... something that was *different.' * There was something new , something different to do , new to experience . One of them said to look up a way to describe 'things ' as he saw a way I could describe them . <newline> <newline> I looked over and pointed , 'I 'm *different ! ' He exclaimed to me . <newline> <newline> They had n't noticed that I was growing , or that I was growing , for a while , until I had developed my powers . Then , my powers did n't stop , even briefly ... They did n't notice , either . <newline> <newline> I became the most interesting human known to humankind . <|endoftext|>
[WP] One day , people began dying . Then a new year , new years , new years of death . Some people had no idea what happened to them . <|startoftext|> `` Mr. President , this is the only solution . We have to figure out a way to stop this epidemic with a few weeks of medical supplies every few months . '' <newline> <newline> `` Thank you ... I see ... . '' <newline> <newline> The President took a deep breath as he stared at the floor in disbelief . What happened next would forever change the world . <|endoftext|>
[WP] You are a soldier stationed on the frontline . All the while , you are desperately trying to make the most of it . <|startoftext|> Every second I 'm working to prepare the next shot . It 's not everyday someone tells you , that you 're making a mistake . And I always find that the next time is a little bit more accurate . I 've seen it all , you see , from the first time I saw a man to the most recent . And yet , this is the moment that has kept me going . Even today , the sky , the stars , a hundred people from across the country have called me . They have all seen , and seen all of my progress . <newline> <newline> I take my new found joy in the simple things . A man in a wheelchair , or a girl with a disability , or some kid who is just hungry for something to eat . I enjoy it . <newline> <newline> Now I 'm at the beginning of what will
