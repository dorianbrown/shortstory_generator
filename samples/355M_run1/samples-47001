[WP] A man from the future is in the midst of his worst day of his life ... and in doing so , he decides to change the future . <|startoftext|> <newline> As his eyes slowly flutter open , the smell hits him like a tidal wave . His head is pounding , and he 's so hot it hurts . The walls are almost at eachother as he clutches his shirt for warmth . It 's all so confusing . Like any normal day , it starts as a chill in the air , and ends on a sweet release in the back of his throat . He 's looking at his phone . His wife was at work the previous day . The weather that day has been a very different one than it was forecast for the previous week . Not only do the trees feel damp , but the leaves are falling about 20 feet at a time . It 's getting a little cold in the house , but he feels good . He gets the television set up and starts the computer . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> `` What do you want on the new edition of my favorite books ? '' <newline> <newline> <newline> **Puny voice of a 20 year old nerd** <newline> <newline> **That of a 30 year old man** <newline> <newline> **And of a 50 year old man** <newline> <newline> **And a retired man** <newline> <newline> **And of a 10 year old girl .

[WP] Write from the point of view of a serial killer who only sees the person they most hate . <|startoftext|> I am my own worst enemy . <newline> <newline> I am the man who spends a good part of the day hating the day . For it is all around him a cloud of hatred and misery hangs over him . He thinks it is his fault , or some other nonsense . It ’ s all very obvious to him . <newline> <newline> I have no reason to care , though I ’ d never give up . I simply have to live my lonely , solitary life .
