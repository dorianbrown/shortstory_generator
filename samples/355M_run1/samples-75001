 Yet - for a moment - no one could tell that something was out there . <newline> <newline> *** <newline> <newline> John started writing about it on his own . Or rather , on that of another person of the other species . <newline> <newline> `` A... how can there be two ... or more '' thought John as he drew another and more detailed illustration of the ... or whatever it was . <newline> <newline> *** <newline> <newline> John drew and wrote another drawing of the ... thing that could not be anything but alien from every dimension he could remember . <newline> <newline> `` Oh , no one really knows just yet as to ... how big 's it looks '' thought John when he 'd started writing . <newline> <newline> `` That does n't matter , not to all who live in this universe '' thought John about the alien 's size , and how it may or may not have once existed , not to him . <newline> <newline> `` Just one more . '' said john as he started drawing again . <newline> <newline> `` A tiny ... small size , in general . '' thought john as he started finishing his drawing . <newline> <newline> John stared at his screen , and began scrolling and scrawling on his computer , making a note of all the words . <newline> <newline> `` This is it . '' thought john when he saw the word 'final ' when he clicked it , and started his writing again . <newline> <newline> And then it happened , and this time , it happened quickly . The aliens finally started showing up , but , at first , nothing seemed to be able to do anything . <newline> <newline> John drew the next drawing , and started scrolling , and scribbling away at the alien 's size , until the last drawing , and this time , everything slowly showed up again and again . <newline> <newline> John began writing a new drawing , and started scribbling for several minutes . The aliens ' size , as the final two drawings ended , was now gone , and suddenly John had an idea . <newline> <newline> John wrote a sentence with words starting with those four words as the last two words of his sentence : `` And so the end '' . <newline> <newline> ** <newline> <newline> **It should n't be here yet but ... here it is in your computer now , you just finished the final drawing '' ** <newline> <newline> `` ... You have just finished the last drawing . Can you guess what I 'm going to call it ? '' <|endoftext|>
[ TT ] What does it feel like to be a young girl and have powers that no one is told about ? <|startoftext|> My little sister , Kayla , is 6 now . She 'll grow up into a strong woman , I 'll help her . I promise . I 'd do anything to have her . I still remember how she used to hold my finger like it was a penis . That thing would get me everything I wanted in a moment . To make her happy . I still love her . But now those powers run rampant throughout the rest of her body , from a little girl 's legs to a tall woman herself . It 's a wonder that I still have not discovered them yet . <newline> <newline> Every few months I meet another body , some new person . I still have n't found my best friend , but I can always count on them . These people are always young , sometimes with powers of their own . A girl 's body is a wonderful thing , if it can be called such , but they 've always been able to figure out how to get me what they need most . Most bodies were just girls , that 's just how they are . But my mother , who 's supposed to be my protector , used her powers to be able to read people 's minds . I ca n't even think of what someone had thought of me as a girl . So the girls I met were usually either girls with powers of their own , or girls with powers of others . That 's not to say that nobody has seen them before . It 's just that they act like girls would think of how it might be , but they 're all the same with their powers . It makes me a bit peeved because their bodies are just so ... unnatural . <newline> <newline> I used to feel like I could fly . I used to want to control my powers . I used to feel powerful . I used to get into the fight with those girls , to beat their spirits . But now I 'm just barely clinging on to life . It hurts to see people who are older
