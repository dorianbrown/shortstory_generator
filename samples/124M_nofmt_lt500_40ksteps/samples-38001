[WP] In the future , every person has an imaginary friend . Friends you no longer recall ever having . <|startoftext|> "Hey, Tim." <newline> <newline> "No man," I say, rubbing his back and thinking about how I missed him by a few minutes. <newline> <newline> "I was so lonely at the time, Tim. So alone really. The only way we could talk was by a stranger, of course, but the stranger did that. He was always talking about things, and I was afraid he would never be real." <newline> <newline> I'm beginning to notice how Tim looks at me, and how deep all of this was. I remember when I first met him and we talked each other down at a football game on my sister's birthday. It's still not the first time, though, and at first I was a bit confused about how I'd grown attached. He seemed like he didn't really see us the same way I did. <newline> <newline> "Don't blame him for it. He didn't mean well." I know it was true, but I can't tell if it's the words. "He was always talking about how much more he loved us. That we've made peace with the fact that we both know now, that we didn't live in the world the way we do. That we were happy to be apart, and we loved each other enough for things to not really get better." <newline> <newline> He stares into me, and I'm so cold. "I've got nothing left in me." <newline> <newline> I'm beginning to cry, which feels wrong. I want to reach for him, but my hands feel too heavy already. <newline> <newline> "I don't have much left," he says, before looking up at me with tears in his eyes. "I'll only be able to sit here, waiting forever." <newline> <newline> "Just sit here for a while longer, Tim," I tell him, pulling him close to me. "Just sit. In this moment." <newline> <newline> He holds my gaze long enough to say, "Tim, this is it." <newline> <newline> "It's never what we think it is," I tell him. "It's the things I do for you. You and me, we are one, and I'm happy." <newline> <newline> But it's too late now. As he's saying this, we start to fall apart. Our connection only lives for another few hours before my brother and sister fall into silence. <newline> <newline> <newline> <|endoftext|>
[WP] Write something heartbreaking without romance or death <|startoftext|> This is it my life was made to last. Every night I sleep by my sleeping bag, in my pocket the note I have written. A note I gave up in the hope that it wouldn't get to a page. The end of a long journey. But it didn't. I knew that if I didn't find her she would suffer more than me. Maybe my family might get angry, but I had to make it. I had to. This was the truth. The reason I made it to a final chapter. I thought it was worth it, but I didn't. <|endoftext|>
[WP] Write a short story as if the person I love is a plant . <|startoftext|> ( ( this is actually a story from the perspective of a plant on paper ) ) <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> The young man stood in the ruins of his house, his eyes still water from the days spent wandering this planet. <newline> He had not seen them in a while, his father's eyes, so red they were, as if they had been red. He did not know what it was about them. <newline> He had not seen them for a while. And he did not yet know how they died. So he had not been alone. <newline> His house, he had seen, was very small in comparison to his new home. Even so, it was a small house, and it had few decorations. This, however, it was very modest. He had not seen his family before. His sisters, his brothers, his sisters- none of them had seen him before. <newline> He had not seen her in a while. He had seen her once. Then again, nothing in a hundred years is more terrifying. <|endoftext|>
