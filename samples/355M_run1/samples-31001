 black . I was wearing a black coat with a hooded cloak hanging out of it . My face was covered in black fur and grey scales . It was weird to me . I was staring at a man in black dressed in black , with hair like this , all this black . It was a strange sight . The man was dressed in black , and with a black cloak . My hands were on my feet , ready to strike them down in quick strokes . `` We 're all brothers here . '' I said holding a knife . `` If you do n't want to talk , you better go . I 'm going to be killing you and every man who steps in your way is going to slit you off . Now kill me , or I 'll go after your family with my whole might . '' <newline> The man was staring at me in that way . I felt something about him . He was staring and he was talking to his children . The black man did n't stop talking , he was talking to his children and I 'll let that come around . His children were all young , some young adults too , even some old and even some barely past 20 . He was talking to them all , `` Kill me or I will make our way through your family , '' he said . I had turned my head , I wanted to see how this man was going to treat my children , and also how he was coming to his children . <newline> I had a plan in place and I was going to teach the man my lesson at just the right moment , but a man in black was coming . He was a man with black fur , black scales and a black cloak and his children were staring at me and he was whispering . They all looked away at the man with shock . `` Stop talking , he knows me . '' I yelled . `` What 's wrong , do n't tell your children not to . '' my father would n't let the kids know his face and then he was gone , I could feel my anger rising . `` Kill me already . '' I shouted . My father would n't listen , he had been coming for this . The man in black had come to my village since one of my children , and he had killed all the villagers he appeared to belong to , a few were men who were n't men and a few women too . `` Kill him , '' I said again . The man in black was walking near the children on a long walk which was the closest to my village , but it was too close I could n't make out what they were saying . I could see my father and son looking at me , who could also see the man in black and was shouting at him . The black man had a knife in his hand , he looked like his father . He looked in me with eyes of terror and then looked back at the children on a path that was n't my path . He laughed once . `` Come now children . Kill me and I will go down for everyone else . '' His eyes were blood red then . `` I ca n't live without you boys , if we do , we all die . '' he laughed once again . The man in black was looking at me then and he was trying to speak but in his black accent when he said it . The woman I stood next to and it seemed like she was staring at him and I could sense her anger at the man with the knife , the black man seemed to be looking at her like he was staring at it as I was looking at him . `` I am sorry child , I cannot let you die I am sorry , '' the black man said , `` but I have done well , I have taken back the land and the people , I have restored the people and I have destroyed your men . I have taken their land and the people , I have left the land and I have made peace on the earth '' the man in black was staring at me with his black eyes and his fingers were stabbing me , the knife was pointing at my cheek , it was stabbing me until I fell to the ground . <newline> I woke up that night and I had a thought , it was a thought like any other . A thought like any other thought , it was a thought like any other thought . I have not seen the same thought , thought like any other thought since . The black man was sitting over the child next to me , I was still looking at him then , I still stared at him . The man in black spoke his words and I could feel it in my belly . `` Your people were killed in the war , and my father wanted to make his son a murderer to use me like as a weapon against my father , and in order to punish him on my account I turned his son into one of my own , '' there was a pause `` and in order to spare you their lives and the life of your children , I have done so . '' The black man was watching me then and I still had my own thought from then . I could feel his pain now
