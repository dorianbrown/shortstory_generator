 A lot of people are still confused by this - what 's to say a buncha people at this point are n't all the same , or it 's possible to look at someone and see similarities without ever knowing their difference ? How can one person , no less than 20 people , be said to hold such an impact , and not be as famous , or important , as another person , in a different way ? There 's a lot of questions to be answered , but as of now I just wanted to focus here on this new phenomenon - when do you look at someone ? I suppose that there are many better answers for that . <|endoftext|>
[WP] You are an average student at Hogwarts , but all students must wear pink tutu in all magic classes . <|startoftext|> `` Welcome ! Welcome to Muggle-Evolutionary Studies ! The wonderful new curriculum for this year includes *magic* ! You need to bring your notebook , your wand , and your boggart . You 'll be responsible for keeping all of your supplies in a safe and secure location . Now if you 'd just get a wand , and open *the book* , you 'll find that the textbook you just *had* written was right . And do n't forget , the wand should only be in your lap . The students , please , take your seats , and get started . You may begin as soon as you finish . '' <newline> <newline> <newline> `` So my name is Harry Potter ? '' <|endoftext|>
[WP] A new law of physics comes into effect : The Earth will now bounce around the most chaotic place to match the most chaotic people . You have the opportunity to live in a city with nothing more *extra* than your phone and a list of friends . <|startoftext|> I 've just received an email , from my sister . And that would have been me if I had n't sent it myself . I had n't told anyone . <newline> <newline> `` Dear me , I have n't done anything out of the ordinary lately . '' <newline> <newline> That response was more than just a message to me . <newline> <newline> *Thank you for contacting me , * she wrote . *I understand you do n't have me . Please give me a call if you would like to speak with me . * <newline> <newline> I have n't heard back for three days . <newline> <newline> My phone was dead . It was now 4:54 pm . <newline> <newline> *Thank you for calling , * she wrote . <newline> <newline> I had n't gotten a response . <newline> <newline> `` It said in the subject line , **I love you . ** '' <newline> <newline> *It 's the one thing I 've never understood , * she wrote . <newline> <newline> `` I 'm sorry . '' <newline> <newline> No response . She had n't responded . There were no people on the number . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <|endoftext|>
[WP] The world 's most efficient super-villain is working on a plan to overthrow the world 's most troublesome superhero . <|startoftext|> `` Hey ! I think I remember a name , '' said Batman to an astonished Bruce Wayne . <newline> `` That 's great ! Do you do anything with your time ? '' he asked . <newline> `` Not really , '' said Batman , `` I 've got other stuff I need to do though . '' He turned off Bruce Wayne 's phone just before Batman had to go to work . `` Are you still not sure what he 's talking about ? Are we working together again ? '' he pondered . He turned off his phone , and smiled at the idea his buddy had . <newline> `` Yeah , it 's not anything I 've done before , '' agreed Batman . <newline> *Batman is a man of his word* he thought . How did he know that the world 's most dangerous super villain only needed to talk to him to pull off some evil schemes ? <newline> `` Well that 's good Bruce , we 're not the same villains anymore , are we ? Maybe that 's why we need to bring our enemies together for some evil- '' <newline> `` Yeah , you know what ? You 're just paranoid . Just give up , I need you to think something through again . The world needs to get rid of these people , '' declared Batman as he turned off Bruce Wayne 's phone , and leaned in close to him . <newline>
