[ wp ] Aliens abduct me for their research for their new form of life , and it is surprisingly interesting . <|startoftext|> I was only 17 when we had first discovered our new planet . It took the government a long time to make contact but they did . We had first encountered them around the year 3117 , they were already doing very well on the other planets in the quadrant . A week after they had first made contact they managed to make contact and offered to spare us their resources to develop their new form of life . As they explained to me how much of their knowledge of our history and world they needed we accepted their terms . <newline> <newline> The only major downside is that they are completely hostile . As a lifeform that has had contact with them they have a tendency to act just as rude and rudely on humans as well . I once lost a friend to one of them for no reason - a pretty easy catch . She asked me to do something and I just said I did n't have time . This time they got bored of talking to us , so they went back to earth and created their own small civilization . The only big issue was getting a mate for a lifeform who took a few months after their initial contact had failed . So they had to work with a member of the opposite sex in order to breed . <newline> <newline> <|endoftext|>
[ IP ] The Lost Expedition <|startoftext|> The dark haired man slowly drew his sword , drawing on it 's hilt .

'' <newline> <newline> <newline> `` Yeah yeah ... yeah ! '' John pulled his cape tight onto his neck as he sprinted towards the mountains . As his feet smashed against the rugged stone walls the wind whistled loudly . <newline> <newline> <newline> `` Thats it John ! '' John held in his arms the man who was once a hero . Now that his sword was long lost , he knew he was in for a long wait . <newline> <newline> <newline> The rocky hills creaked under his feet as his heart pounded in his chest . <newline> <newline> `` What the damn fuck are you doing here John ! '' The strong , dark man shouted . <newline> <newline> The young man , who had been playing the hero of the moment , just shrugged . `` It 's just the way of life . '' <newline> <newline> `` What the fuck do you mean ? '' The young man continued . <newline> <newline> `` What do you mean ? '' <newline> <newline> `` A lot of people are out at these mountain peak . Do you want to help them ? '' <newline> <newline> `` I dunno . We do whatever we want . I hope you enjoy the trip ! '' <newline> <newline> John 's ears perked up as a faint cry came through the wind . He looked . <newline> <newline> `` John , I 'm really getting to hungry ! '' The stranger yelled as he sprinted after him . The young man held on to his chest tightly , and pulled himself up the mountain side . The wind whistled . <|endoftext|>
