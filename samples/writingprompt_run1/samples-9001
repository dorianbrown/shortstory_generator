ve , and my dear John . <newline> <newline> `` Sir ! '' I cried . `` Sir James and Samantha were killed under the last light . We thought it would be just because they were coming from a nearby building . '' <newline> <newline> I paused . `` Sir James is dead . '' <newline> <newline> `` And I 'm not ? '' I asked , still crying . <newline> <newline> `` Sir James is dead . '' His lips pursed . `` I do n't think people are going to be so worried about him anymore . '' <newline> <newline> `` And that you ca n't just tell them . '' <|endoftext|>
[WP] A person falls in love with a stranger in their home who was once your spouse . You live with them until the end of your relationship . <|startoftext|> The first two nights I did n't spend in the same apartment I 'd had since I started living near . And in three , I ended up on the streets and alone in the middle of the city . I 'd never been a particularly big-of-the-time person , but having lived in this area for a while had given me a sense of purpose . I was tired of living in the shadows and lonely and afraid . I found comfort in the sight of others . I was not a bad person , but I never would be comfortable with strangers . <newline> <newline> I did n't even feel the need to bring a firearm anymore . I was more than ready to get to work or just go back and clean my place once more . I had a couple beers and got to work . The only time I was really interested in doing this job was now . <newline> <newline> It was at about 12pm when the door opened . I was almost surprised to see a boy at the door . I could not shake the thought out of my head . My heart was pounding as I saw my girlfriend look at me with her best brown eyes . <newline> <newline> `` Hey , how are you doing this John ? '' she asked in a calm tone . <newline> <newline> `` Good , look at the way your dress is changing . Do n't tell anybody else about my work attire . '' <newline> <newline> The sound of a woman in the front seat gave me an odd feeling of dread . She was in a casual dress , like she could have a few guys in that . She wore an absolutely perfect t-shirt and pants , though I did not know them . She looked like her girlfriend . She wore a thick black button up , her shoes would probably have been too long to pick up at this time of night . Her green hair stood a short straight back and she sat with her two sons and three daughters . She was about my age , but we were close in age , and I could not let go for many years . She must have been beautiful . <newline> <newline> I sat down at the table . `` So , I 'll show you around . But first , why , what 's your background ? '' I asked . <newline> <newline> `` Not my name at all , really . It would seem odd to call the girl by that name , though . The town folk call them 'brithens . ' She was from the town all by her own name , by any name . '' <newline> <newline> `` Well do n't tell , but I live in the same town as your girlfriend , and as long as we have things like this 'brithens '' she told me . <newline> <newline> `` I had a pretty good family in school , so she knew my names and lived there . I like to try to be friendly and I think she 's beautiful . '' <newline> <newline> I was just about to tell her that I do n't know her very well . She was kind of a little annoyed to know , and I had to be careful not to . <newline> <newline> `` You are quite a lovely people . You can not hide things . I mean , I like getting to know you . I have so much to learn about you . I like to think more and more as you grow and develop . What is your favourite colour and what is the type of game you play ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Hmm . '' <newline> <newline> `` Well , I 'm just curious as to what a friend can do with a gun . And the first thing I can say , is that you 're a very beautiful girl . So can you tell me why you liked the color of her shirt ? '' <newline> <newline> The woman seemed very shocked by my question . I could not do much at
