[WP] We 're at a crossroads , and the crossroads are moving . <|startoftext|> I'm a history major, I've done a lot of history. There are always going to be good historical examples of our past. What's new about the current time is I could take it in a different way, with more of a feel for it. I could try the same, but think it's quite a little different. I could go a little less hard, but I feel that's part more of history. I think you could go in with more of an idea of this, but I get a feeling that maybe you could try something different that actually changes the direction of history. It would be a great idea! <|endoftext|>
[WP] You are given a device that tells you everything about your life , but none of it ever happens . It is almost always accompanied with a black screen showing a summary of events leading up to your death . You realize one day that one of the side effects of the device is just black . <|startoftext|> "So what?" the man at the desk asked. <newline> <newline> "You're not supposed to tell me everything? How would that-" <newline> <newline> "How do you..." <newline> <newline> The man at the desk turned with a confused look. "What is this?" <newline> <newline> The man who's eyes were already starting to water. "This is... what, a video camera?" <newline> <newline> "You do the same thing over and over again!" <newline> <newline> "Then how do you like things?" <newline> <newline> "Oh shit, I'm gon na have to take a shit now," he mumbled. He closed his eyes, and began to slowly open them again. "And then tell me how much you know!" <newline> <newline> The man at the desk smiled at his accomplishment. "You're never supposed to know that I know about these things, right?" He looked down at his tablet. The screen would be blank in this man's face. <newline> <newline> "Then..." <newline> <newline> *" That is so stupid." * <newline> <newline> "But we've been through a dozen of them already..." <newline> <newline> "That is more than the ones you've had. I don't know about you." <newline> <newline> "Oh, look. That... it means I know about..." <newline> <newline> *" Shit, I don't know if I'll have to tell you about one more thing." * <newline> <newline> "So..." <newline> <newline> "You've been through a dozen more." The man at the desk shook his head. "I can't do that." <newline> <newline> The man at the desk's legs shook in pain. He looked down in horror, still clutching his tablet. "I'm going to see if this is a coma." <newline> <newline> It wasn't. <|endoftext|>
[WP] `` I 'd never met her face-to-face . '' <|startoftext|> I couldn't help it, but I just wanted to get home. I've spent the better part of the past two weeks talking to my wife at the hospital about this, to have a talk about her boyfriend and the fact that they had never met, or had even mentioned, that she was pregnant ( not that she needed it to be that way ). I can't really imagine what my life would be like if I went to see someone in that situation. I would see them walk in and find the man in front of me not smiling. <newline> <newline> <newline> She'd never met him face-to-face. <newline> <newline> <newline> I knew about him, as I had seen every woman. He'd been a little kid at one point. He'd seen me through the tears. He'd also gotten a tattoo of his face, with a big scar across the top that said "T.O." <newline> <newline> When he was a kid, he was just a child. A girl that didn't yet know how to handle an adult. But even as he looked at the body of the woman he killed, he
