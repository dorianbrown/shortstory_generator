 lived at this stage , his eyes full of fear , fear as to what if he dies ? What if he can not return home to his parents and family ? How do the parents cope with what is about to happen ? <newline> <newline> The last thing he sees is his wife standing next to him , tears streaming down her face , hugging the wound from the broken car . It was her and his wife . Not because they love him enough , but because they know he is not what she thinks of him . <newline> <newline> `` She loves you , he said with a sigh , `` She loves me now , but do n't think that 's love , '' He whispers , tears streaming down his face . As a nurse said to him , do not let your guard down , do not let the darkness take you . He knows . <newline> <newline> Then they leave , leaving him in hospital , his wife holding his hair , and his only friend , his love . <newline> <newline> As he dies , his final thought , as he is lifted off the ground by the darkness in his vision , is `` Why is it my job so quiet ?

[WP] The year is 2535 . Everyone on Earth is wearing wristwatch watches that display how long they have left of their lifetime . Today , the last watch is released . <|startoftext|> `` The time has come . '' <newline> <newline> `` Do n't you know who you are ? '' the old woman asked me . <newline> <newline> `` Oh , yes . '' <newline> <newline> `` It 's been thousands of years since this wrist watch was released . And you 're the only person to experience it . '' <newline> <newline> `` Then you 've had your turn .

'' <newline> <newline> `` I do n't understand , do n't worry , I 'm sure you 'll find some way . The only thing I have to remember is what 'll happen when I go , I do n't have to remember anything , I promise . '' <newline> <newline> `` That 's exactly why I want you to remember . The way my watch changes things , the way others will change it , the way you changed things . So you should remember what happened when you went that you 'll regret that . You know that . '' <newline> <newline> The old witch shook her face . `` I think it 's time . Now that it 's over . '' <newline> <newline> I left the room , and I promised her the same thing . <|endoftext|>
