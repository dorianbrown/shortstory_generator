 in the forest , and to have the power to change the world . <newline> <newline> * <newline> <|endoftext|>
[WP] I was born without father and mother . I am a boy . In my 20s I was brought up under a common childhood insult . <|startoftext|> I can feel my parents calling me a fucking hooch . I never got that in school , where I 'd been the sole student during the day . <newline> <newline> And then my mother 's name was the next person in school and she took my mother to the local high school . My parents were never so nice , the kids are so mean . The girls who were bullied in the same way that I was . So when I got my mom she 's like ' I want you to think that he 'd be a good man as well but he just wasnt . No . He had a good job and the teacher in school was amazing . <newline> <newline> Then we met in high school , my mom was nice too , everything was okay and all of that . But I wasnt the best child to get to school , I mean it seemed like every day I got to go do stuff . You know , to get to work , to go on your own . The classes were so bad that my parents and teachers were like 'oh we better hurry up , I got no other choice today anyway we need to get back on schedule to meet . ' <newline> <newline> Then that day the school was my first day at school , it was n't supposed to be so bad but all the kids told me that I was n't going to be okay and the only thing I could have done was go and talk to my mom about my life . My mother was so gentle , sweet as I was . She told me what had been a terrible day . She said , you better think of what life would be like if it was like that now instead you think of your parents , it was like nothing good ever came of it . <newline> <newline> But when my mom came to my parents I was like 'hehehe she does n't understand shit anymore I do n't even care but you know what when you get back to school after hours on break and you make your friends you get to yell at me and I have to go over here and it could be worse if I take those things for granted too ! <newline> <|endoftext|>
[WP] Make the most of your life as a storyteller . Tell someone you 've always loved . <|startoftext|> `` It 's a shame I was not able to have the most enjoyable year ever . '' <newline> <newline> <newline> `` I do n't know what was going to get you what the most enjoyable year ever was , '' the man beside his father said . <newline> <newline> <newline> `` Not even close , '' the father said . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> `` Well , the one thing I had planned was to go on a vacation , but as this year started I had to spend all week in the mountains at the expense of one thing , which was the children . '' <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> The man looked at his father '' I do n't know how much but I just know I 've been on these things long enough that I 'm not going anywhere '' . <newline> <newline> <newline> `` The family must be worried . The child in my arms is doing fine . I do n't know what happened to the dog that was there last year . '' <|endoftext|>
[WP] After all , if you 're a fan of the show , a guy has to go out on the town . <|startoftext|> The rest of the neighborhood . Not just the big city . But all the suburbs and towns around town that everyone knows. So if I travel in my truck , this is the route I take . If I walk across the country , I walk across the country . These are the people that are standing right in front of me . So when I tell people that they 're going downtown , they 're going to be surprised that I 'm not the guy . <newline> <newline> I know people in my life that know all the people standing in front and waiting for me . <newline> <newline> Most people 's reaction is that I 'm some kind of oddity , a stranger with a penchant for odd jobs and odd cars . These people are people that go to all the places , because I 've traveled to them , and I 'm a stranger with that penchant . <newline>
