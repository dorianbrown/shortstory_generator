 that we could not survive a battle the size of the planet . Our only other survivors . <newline> <newline> There , now , was another world to conquer . For this world , we were called . <newline> <newline> That world , we were known as , was where the world came from . The land with the sun , and the clouds , and the animals that live in them . There , there were great beasts . We were as well known as we were . <newline> <newline> But this time , it was not one of these so-called monsters ... <newline> <newline> That beast , the one that looked for us , I know . A monster that lived in the darkness and thought only to destroy where there was no chance of it attacking . That beast that took nothing from others even when it was weak and thought only to destroy what it could think of . <newline> <newline> But now , he was out there , and the one who would destroy us ... I ca n't think of what monster the monsters would think of us . But if he thinks he can kill us , he will . He would make a pact with us and destroy us . <newline> <newline> And that monster ... that was out there , out there , in our shadow ... I know , I know . <|endoftext|>
[WP] You 're an astronaut on the International Space Station orbiting near Jupiter . As the first signal reaches you , the mission is over , and time is finally over . <|startoftext|> `` AHAHAHAHAH . '' <newline> <newline> I 'm always so proud to see my coworkers in the office . It is hard to explain . I had so many friends who were excited to be on the ISS , but they were not my friends . <newline> <newline> `` Hh , I 'm not a man of action '' <newline> <newline> It was just him . The man who would n't let the Earth go to waste . He stood across the table from me , a bit taller , but I could have gotten to him from anywhere if I knew what he meant . <newline> <newline> `` The next day , John , we were briefed , and there was a brief exchange between Apollo and Mercury , but the two men realized that we had a long-sought purpose : to observe and record all of Jupiter 's gravity , and report on the Earth 's future . As they left , we were in deep space . I have to say , I felt a lot better . '' <newline> <newline> <|endoftext|>
[WP] The people are all of `` no reason '' to do anything , but do n't believe them . They believe they know how to be there , why they believe it , and how to do the right thing . They take no risks , no responsibilities , and they do what they know is right . <|startoftext|> One day it happened , I felt the chill from my apartment , as if something was different . My wife was n't so bad after all : she was just fine . My baby went through the doctors after all . The doctor explained that he needed to get me some tests ... The doctors took my baby and placed it away . You only want to see a doctor , not one you trust . I was very worried about my baby 's health . It looked like it was just a fever after all . I got up and brushed those scabs on my arms . <newline> <newline> I walked up to the doctor and he took my baby 's head right out of the syringe . I grabbed my daughter 's shirt and walked out into the kitchen . She 'd like a cheeseburger . I looked outside , the kids playing was playing their own game . The doctor let her go on the way . I walked towards the door with my daughter , I put her on my belt and looked into front of the kitchen . He opened it and there it was . <newline> <newline> I pulled my wife from the kitchen . Her eyes were bloodshot . I sat at the table with both of us watching the children play and I noticed that my wife did n't look so happy . I looked into her eyes . She had taken a small bite out of her breast . My wife knew that I had nothing left to live for . We sat there . We looked at each other , with the same concern . `` That was nothing . '' <newline> <newline> We said the words that I thought would sound good to my husband . He nodded at me and walked away with my daughter . <newline> <newline> <newline> My next job was an intern . This job was different . My wife had to come home for a very long time . There was no one else in this
