 11 . <newline> <newline> So if this is the end of mankind , and all are gone , is it OK if it does not end ? Is it OK if I could go on the internet again and find out if that 's what the world ended as ? <newline> <newline> I can still hear a few people singing `` Happy Birthday '' all over the Internet , I think . <newline> <newline> I am still scared . The internet is not like the movies ; I ca n't hear what the words are . <newline> <newline> I have found that the end of the world could not be caused by suicide . <newline> <newline> I am scared . <newline> <newline> And a lot less excited . <newline> <newline> <|endoftext|>
[WP] In 100 years , you 're a household member and we do n't know your name ... except that your dog has become popular and you do n't want to know it . <|startoftext|> My name is Tom . I 'm from the UK , but this is my first story here . My name is Tom , and for some reason , it 's difficult to write this story around me . I 'm not really that popular , but I guess I 'm the kind of person who likes to write a good story . <newline> <newline> I really have no real interests other than getting the world to love me - that 's how I make money anyway . I 'm always interested in things I want . I love photography , and the idea of being an actor and working in TV . I 'm almost 25 , so I 'm not a full time actor , but I suppose you could think of me as an actor for a living . Anyway , that 's how I was born . <newline> <newline> And that 's how I was born . <newline> <newline> There 's not really a story here . It 's a conversation between a man and his dog , one on the street , a dog who ca n't talk , and a few people walking past me when I get bored . It 's not much more interesting than what the person thinks of them , since these are all people I 've met through others and I 'm not interested in them - it 's just me , my dog , this dog , walking in the street , and all of the people at the corner of the street , people I 'm not interested in , and I am bored . <newline> <newline> Why is I interested in a dog ? <|endoftext|>
[WP] `` The thing that lies beneath is old and will never be let loose . '' <|startoftext|> The old man knelt beside me , his face was wrinkled and his face was worn . I was so young , I barely knew where my feet were . I stood in his house and I knew it was my place , to let go of my life and my purpose . <newline> <newline> I was nervous . Like I 'm not ready to walk around in this world . I remember the streets , the traffic at the station , the people who have been walking by for years . It 's hard being out there for the first time and you have n't found a place yet . Maybe it 's the age or the lack of direction , but I need my place . I need to go home , my parents had warned me that my life would be over . <newline> <newline> As I raised my head to face him , we did n't speak . I could feel his eyes on mine . They looked down and the man started to get up . <newline> <newline> `` No , I can not be waiting to go home any longer ! No , I have to hurry and hurry and go home ! We 'll be home in a few minutes , I ca n't wait ! '' <newline> <newline> I know where I have to go now . My parents ' house is next to me , there are lots of people there , people who are just like them . <newline> <newline> I 'm going to come home , I need my place . I 'm going to go home , I 'll stay here all night , maybe I 'll have enough time to prepare for my next trip , I have so many friends and there is no time ! <newline> <newline> This is my home , this is a home , but all I see is that , this is my home , I live here , I love this house ; but this is just the beginning ; there 's nothing left to see , not today , not ever . I just wait for this moment to come . <newline> <newline> I love
