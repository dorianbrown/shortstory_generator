 Luck , '' the other responded with a smirk . `` That was a *t-* . '' <newline> <newline> I could feel the tension rising . The guy was a stranger , I really suspected that . Was this all just a ploy ? No one had ever tried to contact somebody like this . He did not know who he was , nor did he know his real face nor his real accent . His eyes were completely red . There was a smile on both faces . <newline> <newline> `` Hey , '' I continued , trying to remember if what he said was an oddity . <newline> <newline> He leaned in front of the mirror and put his big nose against the glass . `` What do you think of this guy ? '' he said into the mirror . `` What 's wrong with him ? '' <newline> <newline> He stopped his nose and looked into my eyes . `` You think someone 's just really weird ? '' I asked . <newline> <newline> `` I think I 'll just see him before you go to sleep . '' <newline> <newline> For the first time in almost two days I thought I would remember hearing an odd joke . <newline> <newline> `` I 'm out of here , '' I snapped at the man standing on the floor next to the mirror . <newline> <newline> The man had a long beard , a big nose and a large smile . He sat up straight , and said , <newline> <newline> `` You know what I do n't know about you ? '' <newline> <newline> I did n't hear a response , and then , <newline> <newline> `` What 's the big deal with me ? '' <newline> <newline> The man laughed hysterically . `` You know , we could have avoided this . '' <newline> <newline> `` But ... and what do you mean what do you mean ? '' I asked desperately . `` I just ... '' <newline> <newline> `` You know exactly what I do ? '' he asked , and then looked back at me with two blue eyes . `` I 've got no idea how I know you do n't have this secret . But I do know that it 's important that you ... and I know it 's the last day I 'll need to know you to be here because no one ever tells me anything . So I need you to tell me . '' He grabbed my hands , and I felt as if he touched the very fabric of my skin . <newline> <newline> `` I said that it is important for me to know , did I not , '' I said . <newline> <newline> Slowly , the man leaned in closer . `` It 's okay , I just needed you to tell me . '' He said , and he looked at me again . `` So . '' <newline> <newline> `` What are you doing ? '' I asked softly . <newline> <newline> The man slowly started to take my hands again . `` It 's because I am the one who tells you everything ... '' <newline> <newline> `` I 'm only the one who knows about my secret . '' <newline> <newline> `` Why ? '' I managed , `` Why do you think I know about your secret ? '' <newline> <newline> For the second time this day the man looked down at my face , took off my shirt and pulled me into a tight hug before he left . I let him slip away into the night and he stayed there , alone , for months , before returning . <newline> <newline> * '' This will never , ever happen . We 're the only ones , '' * he said to me one day , * '' we 're the only ones* . `` *I 'm the only one , you are the only one* . *We are the only ones , * '' he said , and then he pulled me back into the night . * '' We are the only ones ... The only people. `` * He laughed , and then looked at me with eyes as red as the man 's . * '' We 're the only ones ... The only days we will ever be alone , * '' he said , and then he pulled me from my embrace . He placed the man in the bed and I felt nothing . All feelings that I could feel were crushed , all thoughts that were buried in my stomach were gone . <newline> <newline> My eyes suddenly turned closed and my body became unsteady . There was no sound , no feeling , yet there was one . I heard a voice asking for help , `` Please ! Help ! I am needed ! Please ! '' and then there was nothing . <newline> <
