[WP] An alien abduction goes horribly wrong when the human they captured for study escapes and begins to stalk and kill off the crew members one by one . <|startoftext|> **Day 1** <newline> <newline> I was only 8 days old when the ship was discovered . I did n't know where I was at the time , but we got to work pretty quickly . No real real survivors , but that was more than I would have expected . The crew and I were on the ship to investigate our home world when we first arrived . They were n't here to kidnap someone , they were here to do one thing and one thing only : <newline> <newline> **The first human . They did it for us . ** <newline> <newline> `` What ? Why was it so important ? '' <newline> <newline> `` The alien had to be the original . He did n't exist . But they had to be sure . '' <newline> <newline> `` No , he had to appear like us . '' <newline> <newline> `` But he did n't make it himself , we had so much to learn . '' A small gasp came from the team . <newline> <newline> `` We should all have followed up with our superiors when they found us . After all , it might just have happened from the start . '' <newline> <newline> `` I mean , no one expected it to happen , but what the fuck did I expect ! '' a small voice cried `` They all put that in to our bodies ! Their bodies were ... not ours yet . That 's how we killed our captors , and what we saw was some of theirs 's body parts from their own . '' <newline> <newline> `` I 'm not sure we should have realized that before the first thing we did was take out the ship . '' <newline> <newline> `` I was pretty sure I did . '' <newline> <newline> **Day 3** <newline> <newline> I was on my ship studying , when I saw them . The first one I saw was me . My eyes bulged . <newline> <newline> `` We 've been on our own for centuries . None of the others are doing anything for us , save this . We 've come to accept this fact , however many years too many have passed and the last to go are the humans . We had no choice . We were all going to be assimilated for the most part . '' <newline> <newline> I looked around , and I saw two humans in the background . They looked at me with curiosity . <newline> <newline> `` We 're going to be taken out of the body . '' <newline> <newline> `` We have to get ready . We have to leave this ship . '' <newline> <newline> `` I 'd like to see the others , but I ca n't . '' I looked at my team . <newline> <newline> As I looked at the aliens , I remembered that I looked different . <newline> <newline> `` The two of us were the most similar . '' They say in their best english , but they are both trying to sound confident . The two humans are trying to be as cool as possible . <newline> <newline> `` Why would they do that ? '' I look at my teammates , `` You 're gon na be the same , but how ? '' <newline> <newline> `` We were gon na take it , we did n't like the idea . We were hoping those other Humans got us . We needed our brains to function , so why did n't they give us a brain ? '' I think . <newline> <newline> `` What happened to your friends ? '' <newline> <newline> `` We were the only ones . They died before we even set foot this far from the system '' <newline> <newline> `` Why did n't they ... ? '' I ask , `` That ? Their brains were dead . '' <newline> <newline> `` How do you know ? Did you know ? '' <newline> <newline> `` We know . '' the humans say . <newline> <newline> `` How ? ... '' I say . <newline> <newline> `` We were ... we were ... there . '' The humans say . <newline> <newline> `` And they ? '' <newline> <new
