[WP] You know that moment when you get to kiss someone , but you 're still unaware of the other person looking at you . What happens next is not completely understood . <|startoftext|> It was n't that the kiss was awkward . Instead it was the way I felt . The way I had kissed a young girl . It was the end . It was the day . I was never even close to understanding the moment in its entirety . But the only way to understand it is simply by being in a constant state of anxiety and helplessness . It is what I experience so often , and it is how I understand the moment . <newline> <newline> I feel my eyes on those around me . Looking away , trying to figure out what it means to be alone . It is the least I can say . There is nothing else to worry about . Every moment is an opportunity , every scene is a chance , to see someone , to get to know them . I never have to know the details of a person , and the only thing that can help me is that one moment . <newline> <newline> It is the most beautiful moment I 've ever experienced . <|endoftext|>
