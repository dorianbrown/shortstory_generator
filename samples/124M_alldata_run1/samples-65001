 `` But you know , we can actually see our future . Just look at what we are doing on the Moon , that is just incredible ! '' <newline> <newline> He said it with such passion that the room turned back , and then we were back to the meeting room . He had his hand on one hand and two other hand holding the other . Now , I was on him like I was always supposed to be . And now he is on top . <newline> <newline> `` You just look so damn good while I am on top ! '' <|endoftext|>
[WP] The universe is finally expanding into a `` universe . '' After so many years , someone finally discovers how to expand it further to fit an infinitely large `` space '' . <|startoftext|> `` ... how could one , as a civilization , create 'space ' so deeply ? '' <newline> <newline> President Trump leaned back on the couch , eyes focused on the remote next to him , as if in wonderment . <newline> <newline> `` We , as a species , have a special deal . We do n't need to expand , we need to *give* you . '' <newline> <newline> The President pulled the remote off the television , and switched channels . <newline> <newline> `` Why are you telling me this ? Where am I supposed to be ? '' <newline> <newline> There was an unearthly silence before President Trump asked , again , how he could explain the mysterious power ... and the price . <newline> <newline> `` ... it 's just , it 's ... We 're so *stuck* , man ! We have n't had enough ! You ca n't just leave us in this state forever ! I 'm sick of hiding ! I should have had an ... an ... alternative ... that would have been ... what ? '' <newline> <newline> `` The Earth has changed , and now a galaxy within , so to call it a galaxy , is filled with the remains of our species from where we left . Your Earth , with all its people and the rest of the galaxy , was once our home . And you left . '' <newline> <newline> The new president stared at the President with shock and confusion on his face . A shock ... of which the previous president could n't remember , and not this . `` Can you ... could n't you *do* this ? ! '' <newline> <newline> The president was furious , now , his anger rising in waves . For years , for decades , for decades , his words had been forgotten . <newline> <newline> `` There is a way , human ! Please , take this ! Please ! '' <newline> <newline> ... and the President had refused , and he was left alone ... alone with the power that would be his greatest and most powerful asset in the world . <|endoftext|>
[WP] Aliens make contact with the human race . Only to find some humans have developed and are now the most powerful species in the universe <|startoftext|> It was a new era when aliens went out from an early dawn and met us ... <newline> <newline> Well , except for Earth and the humans , they just kind of settled down here and now for a long time ... And that was nice . <newline> <newline> The human version showed up with our technology ... With our ships , with our machines ... . we even had a couple of `` slaves '' . <newline> <newline> Yeah , that 's right . The first `` slave '' arrived in the 22nd century . <newline> <newline> He called himself Donald Trump and he won . <newline> <newline> Trump , in case you 're wondering , is a pretty cool guy . But he is n't the most powerful man in the world . He is a bit crazy , some say , and is n't particularly smart . <newline> <newline> He was an idiot though . <newline> <newline> He was a genius when it came to space travel . <newline> <newline> And for the most part , he was as harmless and stupid as he needs to be , just like everyone else . <newline> <newline> That though , was a huge disappointment to the aliens . <newline> <newline> They just wanted to see us . And we could see them in their ships . Well , we just did n't have the technology to do the mission as they did . And the problem was , the tech was crap ... they had to be so stupid that they could n't understand a problem . It was a wonder that no one ever understood our brains and bodies ... Our minds . <newline> <
