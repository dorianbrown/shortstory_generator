 thought of a god , a god beyond the human realm , an entity beyond that of humans but one who was not himself . <newline> <newline> A human who understood the world at an intimate level , he was the first to be educated on modern day knowledge about the past . A human who had found his way into a world without a prior knowledge of knowledge but who was able to communicate through the power of technology . And who was also the first to be trained in the art of magic to learn it without knowledge of the arts itself . He was given the most advanced technology , the ability to cast simple magic on a single target , and the ability to levitate objects in the air around him . <newline> <newline> That was it , after he had done much reading to learn the arcane , it had been a very long time since anyone else had studied any of the skills they had to learn to fly . He learned the art of magic to be able to cast a single spell that would cause him great bodily harm . <newline> <newline> The trick to the trick of conjuring beings and objects to the target was to cast a single spell per caster , not just one every other spell . Each spell was a single spell and a single object that would be in the air if it were thrown as an uncountable number of feet between the caster and the subject of the spell . At first he cast a single spell per caster and then was thrown the other way round , each round as if the caster had landed in the middle of the square that was thrown . His spell was cast only once and then nothing happened and he could n't be sure if the caster was in another square or not . <newline> <newline> Eventually he had the gift of conjuring creatures and objects , but it was still quite a time to learn the arts at every school of magic , of spellcraft , of the various arts and spells , of magical construction . Most people had no knowledge as there was no magic to be learned , of magic being used to create and repair anything as a magic spell . The world was a great place but there was no good magic to be cultivated there . <newline> <newline> So , he studied in his school and had read the books with as much success as he could , and then was expelled from his school and gone to a new one to learn magic . <newline> <newline> He was one of the first schoolchildren to get his diploma before moving on to the next school of magic . <newline> <newline> After a few months of studying and studying , he had mastered all the techniques of magic for himself and was able to cast a single spell . <newline> <newline> His teacher said he was not an expert , and he was certainly talented , but his knowledge of the world was much further than those of most of his peers . <newline> <newline> He began to make some mistakes as a result of learning a little of magic as a magical trick . He once cast a single spell per caster in a few seconds and thought it was a joke . But , instead he had accidentally cast the spell with a single object that did not fit into any square . <newline> <newline> A few days later , it was discovered that he was not the only boy to receive his diploma after moving on from the school . <newline> <newline> He had been assigned a job as an apprentice in the school but the situation was not particularly advantageous for the other children . Most of the teachers were n't very useful and had their own jobs . <newline> <newline> After a few years without his help , he became more and more difficult to train and understand . He made a few mistakes and started to use tricks and illusions to conjure spells . He also often made mistakes of his own and his enemies as well as of others . <newline> <newline> His teachers eventually learned to control him better , but he also became very reckless and a lot of mistakes often resulted from that . <newline> <newline> He fell into a deep depression and felt depressed for his life . However , he still enjoyed having fun with his teachers and friends over the years . He was the first time that he had truly learned and his favorite was the one he called his own . <newline> <newline> But then , a few years ago , he got a call from a teacher who , not too long ago , had made a huge mistake as one of his teachers . <newline> <newline> `` Hi-I think I can ... '' <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <|endoftext|>
[WP] The world is going backwards and forwards , one day a person from a different planet is making a discovery , but they do n't want to tell anyone about it . <|startoftext|>
