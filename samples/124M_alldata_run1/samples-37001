 angry as they were . It was as if , every moment he knew those words would never come . <newline> <newline> `` You . '' His voice was smooth as ice on summer morning . `` You are what you are . '' <newline> <newline> She did n't need to . His arms would have been too short , and the wind would have been too fast . Even so , she still looked up , her gaze locked with the floor , her eyes searching where her face had been when he had gone through her last week . <newline> <newline> `` You 're . '' He started . The question was no longer urgent , no longer the question that had always eluded him so long . <newline> <newline> `` I 've lived in this house for a very long time , '' She said . <newline> <newline> He looked around in horror as she tried to figure out what she had just said . His eyes caught hers as she slowly came to herself , her head facing him and his face not in anger but instead , a frown . Just a frown . <newline> <newline> `` What do you mean ? '' she whispered . Not understanding his face now that she knew . <newline> <newline> I looked into his eyes and realized that he looked even more angry than he did . <newline> <newline> `` It 's time you left . And for the last time , you do n't want to live in the past . '' <newline> <newline> She turned her head to face him and his smile made her shiver . `` Goodbye . '' <newline> <newline> The wind still blew but her face remained stoic and silent . <newline> <newline> `` I 'm not sure if I can live this way , '' The wind said as he rose on his feet . The water was so gentle . It was so calm . <newline> <newline> `` Do you wish to live it , '' she spoke with a smile . <newline> <newline> `` I do n't want to die , '' He said . <newline> <newline> She could n't hear . He was right . She felt safe . <newline> <newline> `` How long , do you think we should go , '' she asked . <newline> <newline> He looked at her , `` I do n't know . I think I could go now . '' <newline> <newline> `` And , do you think you deserve to live your last moments as if that 's the only thing we have left ? '' she asked . <newline> <newline> `` I 've loved and been loved for so long , '' He said . `` I do n't think it would make the best choices , '' His fingers dug into her skin until they found nothing but sand . <newline> <newline> She looked back , `` I do n't know . I do n't feel any different . I just do n't feel this like it would change what has been . '' <newline> <newline> He felt his life come crashing down , he felt all the love that he had ever felt for her that he had felt for her for so many years . <newline> <newline> `` I do n't want that , '' she whispered , `` I do n't want to die , '' and that was the final word that she said . <newline> <newline> She felt the cold trickle of a knife as she laid there . <|endoftext|>
[WP] The first robot uprising has begun . However , humans do n't seem to notice as there are reports of all robots being turned loose . <|startoftext|> Day 1 : New data on the robot problem <newline> Day 2 : It 's a difficult problem . There is a massive increase in data usage , but I do n't know what the problem is any more . Data transfer is becoming more common , and people who 've recently been given a new robot is starting to take a more ... artistic view of this new world . But , more data is being added . People have begun dropping dead more or less in droves . What started as a group who were left with just a handful of data on an issue is now a big player . They 've noticed a noticeable decrease in population of humans . But the increased activity in the robots seem to be the result of a bigger influx of people now . <newline> Day 5 <newline> Day 7 : They seem to be more active and more active . Most have been given this new machine , but they seem to have stopped giving it much thought . The problem seems to be the loss of empathy by the humans after a few days . Some of the newer humans seem to think this is
