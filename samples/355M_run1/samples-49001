 much up to now . I 'll see you soon ... <newline> <newline> Good night ... <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <|endoftext|>
[WP] The world is now run by robots . The government has made a policy requiring that every citizen is equipped with one , and each has a choice -- sell their personal device , or use it to kill themselves . You have decided to sell your custom-fitted device . <|startoftext|> `` Well , how 's it going ? '' <newline> <newline> That was the only question that could be answered . <newline> <newline> `` Good , '' the president replied , `` I just took a few pills today - nothing too hard . It took an entire day just to get out of bed . '' <newline> <newline> `` Yes , '' said Dr. Jones , `` I 'm just glad you 're here . '' <newline> <newline> `` Thanks . I guess , that 's the point of our mission . The only people who would willingly trade for the right to die , and we 're the only ones who do so . How do you feel about it ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Well , I was expecting more to be in my mind than this . A few people I know would not mind my suicide , but to trade up ... well , here I go . '' <newline> <newline> `` Ah , yes . Yes , I 'm sad to say that , '' replied the President . `` However , I 'm not that sad for you . You 've just received permission to do it with a gun I 'm sure . '' <newline> <newline> `` Right , '' retorted Dr. Jones . `` Just one request , if you 're going to continue . The rest , as always . I have something I need to do . '' <|endoftext|>
[WP] You are on your way to work when you come across a man who looks identical to God . <|startoftext|> I was walking past the supermarket , carrying my morning coffee . As I passed the parking garage I noticed a peculiar man walking down the road . Standing up straight with white hair , and a big face . <newline> `` Excuse me , sir . May I help you ? '' I said with a slight curt nod . The man , whom looked as if Jesus himself , seemed to be holding something . I picked up the small object , and held it tightly in my hand . <newline> `` I 'm so sorry , I-I 'm ... I 'm sure . '' God said in a loud , deep voice . <newline> `` Well ... Is this God ? '' I asked with a smile . <newline> `` Yes , yes . '' God said with a smile , `` I am , I just do n't remember who I am . '' <newline> `` What is this , some sort of ... ritual or sacrifice ? '' I asked . <newline> `` What I intended to do . '' God said with a smirk . <newline> `` What do you mean ? '' <newline> `` You do n't understand . '' <newline> `` Does this not matter ? If not , why does it matter ? '' <newline> `` What you do , no matter the reason . I 'm just a product of my past . '' <newline> `` Why do you have a beard ? It 's nothing like anyone else . '' <newline> `` My name ... I just can not get it . Maybe I 'm just ... born weird . '' <newline> `` I do n't want a beard . I want a beard . It matters not why you do n't remember it ! '' <newline> `` I do n't know . But I do remember the name of the man behind you . '' Said a man with a very big beard , wearing a dark blue business vest and with a thick , white beard . There was a huge smile on his face . <newline> `` You know ... Jesus . '' <newline> <newline> ( First time posting a prompt and this was actually my first attempt at this so any feedback is appreciated ! ) <|endoftext|>
