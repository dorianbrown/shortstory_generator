======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 hours a day I was so tired so that they did n't have to wake me . It 's not like these people are going to find me , so you 're still awake when I go out . <newline> <newline> It 's not because you 're so smart as to not wake me up every morning . If I sleep at all , it would be because I 'm so tired and it 's really hard to find a job . I 've heard stories from people that they got paid to do a job like that because they were told they were paying for a lot of extra time to get out of bed . So the only time I can get out of bed is if I 'm hungry and then it takes me the entire time to get out of bed before the kids get kids . I do n't do that and if it does it 's because the kids are so hungry . I do n't sleep until I get enough sleep and then it takes at least a week to find a job . I don â€™ t eat anymore because it takes forever . <newline> <newline> My last sleep comes when I wake up tired and I 'm almost ready to go to work . <newline> <newline> I have slept quite a bit in the last three and a half years as a child . I guess I was born without sleep , but I still just wake up when I want to . <newline> <newline> If I can get the last one right , I 'll be the happiest person on earth , too . If you look up at the sky , you 'll see a glowing light which glints behind you . The light in the sky reflects sunlight . Every time I turn in the mirror I can see that reflection again , but never for the first time since I 'll be in full darkness . There 's a bright blue glow shining behind us . We got my new baby girl , but she 's just not me . I 'll go back in time and see how many children I 'd lose for doing what I do . Because when I grow up , we 'll go back in time and see what it was like back in the day before I went to work . Or if I want to get some sort of extra salary and work a little more , I 'd go with my mom . Now for the worst part . I ca n't walk , you know . She 'll be the best one . <|endoftext|>
[WP] You are the most powerful person to have ever known , and the only person who knows when you finally meet your death in the mirror , in front of your wife ? <|startoftext|> `` You have to be kidding me ! '' I exclaimed . <newline> <newline> She 's not real , she 's just a ghost . At first , I thought I was crazy . <newline> <newline> But then we had some sort of connection . <newline> <newline> I knew a long time ago that nobody knew the truth on my face . <newline> <newline> I just knew . I had a special connection to her , someone who would hold my hand , to look at her face , to touch it , even though nothing seemed to be there anymore . And I had to , to show her how I felt . Even then , it was n't fair . What did that feeling make me feel ? It made me wish that I could just feel the hand on my wife 's shoulder . <newline> <newline> Maybe some day I will find the truth . <|endoftext|>
[WP] The human race has finally settled into a world where most people can no longer live happily anymore , and the world is about to be transformed into an unfettered wasteland . <|startoftext|> The world was just beginning . The universe was starting to move towards peace . The universe knew it would eventually bring that peace to the Earth , but they knew that peace would not be guaranteed . <newline> <newline> `` It 's not that we will always be united , its just that we are n't always united , always ... we only unite when you must , in every way . Today you will have a change , a change that will be the greatest victory . You may never know it 's a change , but you will see it . '' <newline> <newline> And so , we all know the words of our friends and allies in the new world . We all hold those memories in high esteem , and we all know those people who have been the most vocal critics . Our closest friends , who were so important to our development . Our closest friends , who we 'd call good and trusted , who will lead the charge . We 'd all be our own world in peace . <newline> <newline> We 'll be in the middle of the world
