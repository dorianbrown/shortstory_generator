======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 husband and his wife, the family he once made, the kids he lost, the grandchildren they will never see, the joy he feels as we finally get to meet another day, the memories he felt, the time he looked forward to, the days when he said a happy story to his kids, and he could hold them so close that he'd always be there for them, the days he was out and not so so at home, the days spent talking to them, the days I held him so tight as he sat in his house with his Mom and Dad and their children, the days when I brought it home with me, the days when it was my daughter who would always comfort me, and I watched his family's life fade away. <newline> <newline> The worst part is... I don't have these memories anymore. It wasn't long now. It was my baby boy. Mommy came home for me, tears streaming down her face and her arms wrapping around me until her lips parted and her lips parted just like her lips parted when she spoke. She took my son with her until we were safe, and it was okay for us to grow apart, I know, that was it, that had been my son too. I had been with him as much, and now I looked forward to finally being with as many children as he will. <|endoftext|>
[WP] A new species of aliens have come to invade . However , they are all wiped out or killed by a species like humans . Make a story that feels sad , epic , and terrifying . <|startoftext|> *What are you wearing? * is the last thing I heard before the ship hits the planet. My blood rushes to my skin, and I let the blood rush to the surface. <newline> <newline> "Do you smell a lot? Or?" I ask, running inside my ship to investigate something. <newline> <newline> "Uh... I kinda smell like my breath", I thought. The ship, or creature as I call it, is an alien ship. The last of the life on Earth, it's kind of... kinda cute. The water from the water of Earth is a lot different from what the ship was. <newline> <newline> I start to wonder if I am a very lucky man or something crazy, but I keep watching as the ships get closer. They appear to be powered by something, so I think maybe it is me or someone else. If this sounds like some weird story line, I can probably tell it to my wife with a high-pitched voice. <newline> <newline> I am walking along a little river and stop when the last ship is here. I look past the glass surface of the ship and see an enormous creature. Its face looks more alien than the one I saw, though the creature does not look human. After a few seconds, I see that its eyes are green. It looks at me with an expression that I would never have seen from an extraterrestrial. <newline> <newline> "How do you think I'm doing here?" Its eyes ask. <newline> <newline> I give up easily, being the only one to know the answer, so I continue walking. I am suddenly surrounded by people. I feel sick of the creatures. I look around, and a man, dressed in rags, is holding a spear. <newline> <newline> "My god, how did they take me from you??" I try, but the spear is stuck in his back. <newline> <newline> "They were here," he said. "No harm we can do to you. Not for a single bit." <newline> <newline> "Why? How am I supposed to explain it?" I ask. <newline> <newline> He looks at me with confusion. "It's just because we're a long time friend that we are here for each other's sake." <newline> <newline> I don't answer before he grabs my spear and slashes it into me. I felt cold as he tried to stab me, but as his neck was being sliced by the spear, I was just relieved that the pain was gone. I walk towards my wife, and I find she is crying. My wife looks shocked, but is holding her tightly. <newline> <newline> "Why? What makes you do it?" I ask. <newline> <newline> "I'm sorry, it didn't do anything we weren't allowed to do ourselves. Please, just stop." She said with tears in her eyes. <newline> <newline> I let her go and return to my ship. I had left a small note on my ship that said "We are here on good earth, but your side is fighting too best we can." <newline>
