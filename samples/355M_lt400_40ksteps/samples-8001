otion 's on again . When it first got too large , you could imagine a huge red sun , scorching everything , until there was nothing left but the wind . In this moment of light , of course , you see a tiny speck of it . You know it 's not too small , because you know it 's a tiny speck anyway . <newline> <newline> What makes you wonder about this light , isn ’ t it ? Well now you ’ re gon na make its a big deal . If you had a small speck of this little thing , it might be cool . It might even inspire you ! It might even give you a chance to see the glory of man . But you know what kind of thing a speck of this little thing makes ? Well , you know what it would be ? I ’ m more interested in something other than being tiny but very tiny . <newline> <newline> I like things that are tiny , but very small . Things that can do something amazing . And I like things that can be large or small , big or small . Well this is the perfect combination . My little light is just an extra . <newline> <newline> It ’ s called a sparrow . <|endoftext|>

[WP] Aliens attack Earth , and it is humanity 's turn to defend ourselves . <|startoftext|> `` It was n't like those damned aliens ! Those goddamn alien fucker came in through the void . They came in through the air like lightning , swooping down like lightning across the sky . We went up in some damn canyon or something and they just blew us back . <newline> <newline> The aliens took the Earth in for them .
