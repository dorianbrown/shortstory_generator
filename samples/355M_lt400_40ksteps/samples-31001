[WP] You are the second coming of Christ . You are here to claim your sibling as your own . <|startoftext|> I was the Son and I was in the Garden of Gilead but not of Eden . I had been here far longer but had yet to witness the Garden of Eden . <newline> <newline> I was the Messenger and I would be the Truth before I return . I have been watching over the world watching over others . I see many do not realize that they have always known God is here but had not sought out the truth . They still do not know it because it is not there . The truth does n't require your presence . I have been watching and watching as you have all tried to be in the presence of God and he has left the garden . If you do not remember the truth of it then you can not be loved by the truth . It is your turn the Truth to love . <newline> <newline> In the presence of God . <newline> <newline> With this knowledge , you have the ability to love one another when you are not in the presence of love . Love has nothing to offer in return but can be offered in a form of love but with words . Words or words and in the presence of words have power and understanding . I have seen all of you love in one place and love in another . <newline> <newline> I am here for you to see and love one another as I have seen most of you . Let go and join the ones who love one another in the joy and love that comes from knowing one can love and understanding one will reach the other . <newline> <newline> I have seen the kindness and generosity of a man as I have seen the mercy and mercy of a world . <newline> <newline> I have seen the strength and strength of a mother and the strength of her child . <newline> <newline> I have seen love fall as lovers fall . <newline> <newline> I have seen the power and powerlessness of a husband and the power of a wife . <newline> <newline> I have seen love grow as lovers grow . <newline> <newline
