[WP] The world is divided into two factions : the `` Good '' forces and the `` Bad '' forces . As war has ravaged the Earth , they have been forced to the fringes of the world to protect what is rightfully theirs . <|startoftext|> `` No , the humans ... They are n't good enough for us , any way we can think of . They 've done this to us , and the only way to keep back the blood tide is to destroy them all . '' <newline> <newline> Lieutenant Oleg Bakharian stood on the landing pad of the USS *Pacifica* , a modernised version of the original American naval vessel . <newline> A new pair of marines had come out from a hatch on the side of the craft to inspect the destruction the war had wrought on their home planet .

A man and a woman lay on a couch being held in the arms of a baby . A man , with only one arm , was struggling with the woman as she attempted to free herself and give him a quick look of how the world was becoming as one . <newline> Bakharian knew that they had come to a conclusion .

He could not be seen through to prevent the destruction of his people . There was a place for him . They held a view of his people and their values , a place where he was granted the mercy of their kind . A place for Bakharian . <newline> <newline> `` Lieutenant , do you think this is a fair price for freedom ? '' a voice intoned . <newline> <newline> His face turned grim , he realized he was speaking to the leader of a group they had called 'the Earth People ' . His hands looked frozen to the end of a gun , he had never been a gunner before now . He knew them by name . He knew them well . Their kind had led to this end , to freedom for his people . <newline> <newline> It seemed like a terrible price for their
