======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 next was a tall man . Tall , a bit chubby , with skin so fine it looked like he got it from just one of his many jobs . To the side of him was a small crowd , almost like a zoo for the homeless . But it 's only him . <newline> <newline> He was the guy who came around every day after work to pick up the trash for the homeless . He did n't really want the money , but he thought he owed it to give the homeless , or something , the help of someone . The homeless was a different thing , and no amount of money could buy you a clean street or a safe place to stay up all night . The homeless are the ones that make you want to live . <newline> <newline> The homeless are just the normal homeless , you see , always there when the world needs a little extra shove . Every single day he would go and take a dumpster , and then he would come see all those people and tell people they are worthy of it , and that they are worth saving . Some would take him up on it , but he just told them it 's for charity . Then more would go to him , and he 'd say `` You 'll need more help , I 'm sure , you 're worth more than it . '' And it was all he ever asked for , more than most others . <newline> <newline> As he went around with his day , he would say a few words . He would tell people they 're worthy , that they 'll be happy to work here , and that they will take what time they need to get to work . <newline> <newline> Most people would just ignore him . He knew better . He knew people were n't meant to judge these homeless people of the world . He would remind them there were people around , and it meant they were worth saving from this thing called `` poverty '' . <newline> <newline> The homeless people were n't always there . The homeless were coming and going , and when the homeless came over , they always came together to be saved from the same thing he was . Not even able to save everyone from the same thing . <newline> <newline> Most people did n't care about the homeless , but it was the homeless that cared about the homeless . Some people loved the homeless . Some did n't . They would give them money , or atleast pay a little to give them enough money to give them a few days . But the homeless always knew that if he saved all the poor people , he would save most of the homeless off from poverty . <newline> <newline> The homeless were always there in the alley , they were always there waiting for the homeless to go , they were always there when the homeless were in a group , but it was always the homeless who were in the group that always came . <newline> <newline> It was the homeless alone in the alley . It was the homeless alone and in the alley that the homeless would come together and help the homeless because that was why the homeless existed . He would always put the homeless back in the alley , and he would know who he needs to save , he would always know to give the homeless a place for his shelter . <newline> <newline> He would know when the homeless were near . When the homeless were near , he would save the homeless from themselves . The homeless would come along , pick the homeless out , and give them a place or some food or what have you . They would put a small hole in the garbage can , or maybe some water so they would get clean water and not just waste away . <newline> <newline> Then it would n't matter . <newline> When the homeless were near , he would be alone . When the homeless were near , he would just be alone . But for him , he was never alone . <|endoftext|>
[WP] It is our understanding that there is a God , a supreme being who is being persecuted by an unjust society . Write a story in which the antiestablishment/religious movement makes contact with Jesus Christ as the benevolent being who saves us from the forces oppressing us . <|startoftext|> `` Jesus Christ , please help me , please let me be free , I do n't want to be a slave this time . '' said the young homeless woman as the homeless man approached . `` Do n't you remember our last message ? We were told to put things up on a pedestal , that we would be sent to your hometown and we were told not to do anything , to go to your school and listen and be good and be kind . And you told us not not to do much because we would be taught . Just so you guys remember and I 've got one thing . '' she said . `` Your friends who lived on the street ? They would hear those things , because my
