 dishes was to me . I took that as comfort . <newline> The sun was rising . I stood behind me . I thought that was the moment , and the moment never lasted . I let my vision rest . I was a hero . I was the hero , and the hero did n't want to let me down . They told me it was my duty to be just like them . All they gave me , it was my duty to show them . It was their duty to let others know that , no matter what , that was what we did . <newline> I did say goodbye to them . I tried to do the same to him . <newline> He told me all these things . <newline> `` It was for you . '' <|endoftext|>
[WP] You have a superpower that nobody else has known or even seen . But it turns out that your superpower is the most unusual thing you 've ever done : you can alter a person 's thoughts . By accident , your powers can actually change what they would be like if they were completely normal . <|startoftext|> It was really a shock , but it did n't really hurt , it really did . I felt like I 'd get laid a few times , because I have no idea what that is , but it seemed to be something I 've had before . Not what I 'm really looking for , but what I want to be , and what I want in life I can see in the world . Maybe that 's for the best ... <newline> <newline> Maybe it 's just that ... feeling of relief that I 'm back home . Or maybe it 's like I 'm back in a place where I had the ability not before , only now I ca n't see what that is , and I want to find what it is for myself too . <newline> <newline> <newline> Maybe it 's just maybe this will be my last experience . <newline> Maybe it was a really hard pill to swallow . But once again I 'm finally home , where I have all the time of my life . <newline> <newline> I 'm going to die soon , and just like that , I 'm not getting a clue . <|endoftext|>
[WP] Tell me the story of a suicidal hero before they fall into the trap that they were told . <|startoftext|> There was no escaping . <newline> <newline> This war had been fought with men , who were too proud to be brave , or that they could withstand the power of their own power . For these men , who had been cast forth after such struggle , were not worthy of war . They were men , like themselves ... They are the ones who had been cast up ... They are those that would have fallen . <newline> <newline> There was no bravery , for these men were made to fight for nothing . And once they had fallen , they were bound by their own blood , and no one could challenge them . The war was fought for no reason as such , as it was a battle between men . For no one could fight for these men , but the warriors fought for their own , and the sword was the man who held the sword . The warrior would fight to the last man , and his sword was his , and he would fight to defend this fight . That man would fight for another man , and once that man had a strong sword within himself , it would then fight back , against the enemy , against the enemy . And so it would fight . There is no glory in this fight , nor is there any ... <newline> <newline> And once that sword had fallen , there was none left . <newline> <newline> Then someone died . For they had fallen , and they were all too eager to fight for the fight , to try and hold out against the enemy 's forces , and they were all too eager to die . <|endoftext|>

Do n't tell the story you tell it . <|startoftext|> A man going about his daily life , the more and more he looks back , he begins to notice something very much like he was staring at the man , he slowly goes to look at a picture of the man on the other side of the photo and he sees a small white button down to the left in the picture . His first memory of this button is the picture he gave the man , and he remembers what happened , he does n't remember much of what happened , his memory now seems to be as if he did n't make it . He is now a man of many memories , the image of his life is almost like what he made in his life , his memories are so clear looking , he has only moments of recollection , the person he was
