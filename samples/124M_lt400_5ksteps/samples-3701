======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 Go , to the top of their lungs , and to me they looked like little , tiny , children . I know the ones I was in . <newline> <newline> But they could have gotten them out faster . <newline> <newline> The children went from one of the children , they grew back and I did not . But what I could do was get them out of their minds . <newline> <newline> I wanted out their names . <newline> <newline> I want out their parents names . <newline> <newline> I wanted out their social and social class . <newline> <newline> And so the next day I started to eat some lunch , and then I left my job and moved to a house . I had no friends , no family . <newline> <newline> And that changed when I met one of the children in my dream . They were twins . <newline> <newline> `` Please stop playing with him because he 's your big sister '' . '' <newline> <newline> That was their first encounter . <newline> <newline> And then the moment came when I gave them out their names . They were a lot more than a little bit different . <newline> <newline> <newline> <|endoftext|>
[WP] In a video game , the player controls a super-powered NPC who is tasked with providing a personal service to the player . <|startoftext|> The player has to make the decisions for the characters over their course of action . I ca n't say exactly what 's being provided . Will it be a fight scene or an exposition scene without the character doing absolutely everything within their powers to kill the player ? Will the story be told to the player and not the player ? How would characters know their character was the killer ? What happens to the story if the Player dies or the Player kills the player or the story is ended with nothing after the Player dies . <newline> <newline> If we were to ask the player what they want out of their superpowered character he could tell us and the player could have a choice . The players would be surprised by some of the decisions the player made , like the `` Save the world '' or `` The last one '' or the `` Save the world '' or the `` Save the world '' or `` Save the world '' or the `` save the world '' . But there would be many choices the players could choose and it would be the Game Over . They would all have to agree on a winner or it might be the end of the story , but the Game over would end right after the Player had won or they might end everything ? <|endoftext|>
[WP] The story starts from a prompt that comes naturally to me , from prompts that I 've thought of and ones that get me thinking . <|startoftext|> When I was a kid , I thought I was immortal . That 's when my powers were n't born yet , but soon I 'd be . Like many other things , I never understood that I was immortal , but when I did , it just made me tick . I knew that in time , all those dreams , those nights I would give people away because they liked me , in a sense , who I was that they loved me . But at some point , things changed . For one moment , you knew that you were not immortal or immortal , your life was just a story with you . Everything else happened as though . It was like magic , the universe was just a story with you . One day , someone else died . They were just memories , and we would never know . <|endoftext|>
[WP] You 're a janitor in a large firm . You 've just got to run an emergency alarm for the boss when someone falls ill and dies . <|startoftext|> You 've had enough of this nonsense . There 's always a boss and I 'm no less than seven feet up the window . His name is Richard . He 's got green hair and no sense of shame . I 'm a sick and scared person , but that 's what I 'm going to do . I need my name in writing , and not just by chance . There 's a new boss , but you 're just going to have to read this first . <newline> <newline> A small group of people are gathered along the roof . His name is Richard . This boss 's name is Richard . How could I have a better job . I 'm not really going to get out of this company . Why does everyone have to keep trying to murder me ? I do n't really know who Richard is . But I know him . His name is Richard . I 'll give him a name so he can come over to me and be his boss again .
