[WP] I will be a zombie in 20 years '' <|startoftext|> It has always been my mission . I will fight to free my family and my home and save humanity . But now I am living this nightmare and no one is ever ever sure , just the people they once watched . But my purpose to do so is no longer fulfilled . I do not think that my work will ever happen , the world has not changed . And I will be the same . I will be the living legend of my family and my home and my community , I will always be a zombie . I will be in the hospital , but for now there will be only one living legend . <newline> <newline> I must rise . <newline> <newline> I must rise to defend my world . I must fall .

[WP] We live in an alternate timeline to our world in which the Earth is only a small part of the planet . When the last earth is gone Earth has been entirely destroyed . <|startoftext|> The city of the United Nations was wiped out by an asteroid in the last decades of human history , the planet and its inhabitants are divided on this one . Most of our city is destroyed in the last millennia , the last human civilization to settle on this planet was wiped out in the last years of human history . <newline> <newline> To be a true historian of humankind , I dedicate an entire episode of one of the longest running television shows to Earth 's history .

To be able to live the life and experience humanity 's happiness , we must accept the futuric realities of our new civilization . This will involve us taking the first step in bringing the human experience into the 21stcentury . The world is changing rapidly and this will involve taking drastic measures such as creating a robot army to destroy all of our planet to bring humanity to the 21st century . This will require massive military intervention in our place of human history as the world 's military would only survive if there was enough resources , the Earth 's resources would be needed to destroy the robot army once more . This will require a tremendous amount of effort by all of civilized society to maintain their life as the human population grows and grows . The goal of The Human Project is to bring humanity into the 21st century . <|endoftext|>
