 accepts her. ” <newline> <newline> “ I am sorry , I really want to get married , it is my favorite moment. ” He said holding her hand , he told her that her husband and her lover had not spoken , but he wanted to let her say , “ I really should get married . He really loves her too . I miss him too . Oh I love you , thank you . Please go on. ” <|endoftext|>
[WP] The protagonist , not recognizing the plot , tries to make a lame attempt at humor . <|startoftext|> “ No , no , NO , NO , NOO ! ! No one will understand . I apologize and apologize and apologize again , ” I shouted as I ran down to the podium . <newline> <newline> I have a tendency to overreact whenever I get nervous , especially when my life is at stake , and I had to take this moment to let it sink in . So , I took two steps forward and waited for the crowd to give in around me . <newline> <newline> When I was about to make my first mistake , the crowd stopped and looked on in astonishment as I fell to the floor . <newline> <newline> My eyes fell to the floor , and for a moment I thought I was seeing my own face , but my sight was reversed to the side . <newline> <newline> The crowd immediately went silent , and the man looked at the crowd incredulously before turning around at the crowd and rushing back to the podium . <newline> <newline> `` Oh my god ! That guy in the back of the crowd was getting a little closer ! I never lose sight of my plot ! Oh crap , what if he catches me ! '' <newline> <newline> The man started to run away . His eyes were blurry and the crowd was moving in front of him . He ran as fast as he could to catch up to him and the crowd started running towards him too too . The crowd , seemingly in slow motion , was split into two ways ; one direction was chasing him , and the other followed his progress by a full two steps . <newline> <newline> `` I got it ! Look ! I 'd never seen you like that again ! '' He yelled as the crowd began to chase him back toward the venue . <newline> <newline> But the man stopped as he stopped running after he came to a stop . He took three steps forward before he was met with the crowd 's eyes , which had grown a little darker . <newline> <newline> I tried to help him as I always do , but my arm felt weak . <newline> <newline> <|endoftext|>
[WP] Aliens finally discover that Earth is the only planet in the universe they know , except for a single , tiny speck orbiting the Sun . <|startoftext|> The first two hours after the discovery were n't the happiest days for us . After all , we are an intelligent species , we just do n't realize it yet . So we spent a lot of time at night talking about what it means to be Earth , and what life could have possibly started on Earth . Our closest neighbor , the LZiLb5i , had already discovered Earth , but we 'd never really considered that possibility . So it seemed like the best idea to explore what Earth was like , and if we found anything interesting there . After the discovery that we were the only intelligent species in our sector , it was n't difficult to find something new . Sure , there were some odd facts there such as the planet was n't actually a planet , but instead a system , and it 's inhabitants had been referred to by the name `` Earth , Earthlings '' - a reference to Earth 's native inhabitants from the region known as Antarctica . <newline> <newline> As it turned out , the Earthlings were actually a rather large species . If you look at it from their viewpoint , they were actually a very peaceful planet in comparison to our own . They 'd had a pretty stable world the majority of the time , and most people on Earth knew them from the moment they were spotted . But since the first detection of the Earthlings , they 'd been on Earths side fighting terrorism . <newline> <newline> This new knowledge was of course welcomed by the species in question , who we 'd been able to send a message to . Our first contact with Earthlings was decided by which of them were killed in the attacks of September 11th , 2001 . <newline> <newline> After a week of constant communications , it was finally confirmed . The `` 10-20 Year War '' was actually happening . Over 3 billion people were killed in the actions . No-one wanted to die when the next war started again
