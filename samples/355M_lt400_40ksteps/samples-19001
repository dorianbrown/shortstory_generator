[WP] You have a power that is a little bit stronger than its name . <|startoftext|> What do you think ? <newline> <newline> It 's funny , you know . <newline> <newline> When it happened , I did n't know it would come back . <newline> <newline> When I found the lamp , I was n't expecting it to just suddenly appear . <newline> That was about three days ago , in fact . <newline> <newline> When the phone rang , I almost went nuts . <newline> <newline> When the phone rang , I was n't expecting it to be for the best . <newline> <newline> When I woke up , I had so many questions . <newline> <newline> Who am I ? <|endoftext|>
[WP] Make a list . Anything you would n't normally think about right now , then break it down tomorrow morning . You do n't use any of it . Your mind is not being controlled . <|startoftext|> My name is Jack and I was born alone . <newline> <newline> Today is the day I start to notice the change in the world around me . <newline> <newline> I 'm not sure what happened , but people start to change . I do n't see a light anymore anymore . I can see people . I can hear that the wind is cool to the touch , I can see them . <newline> <newline> I can hear them speaking . A lot . I can read all that they say . I can hear their words , their voices , their actions , their voices . They are n't able to see me , that is . <newline> <newline> But they know me . They always have someone , but I am the only one I know they have left . <newline> <newline> I have been given a pen by someone , someone I 'm scared . I have heard of horrible things , they hurt me before . I have been in this world . <newline> <newline> They do n't even know me . <newline> <newline> <|endoftext|>
[WP] In a world where everyone has a superpower ( like superstrength that lets you fight off objects in a physical way , or super speed to catch anything ) , everyone is born with a disability . You are the person who is the only one who can not use their superpower yet you have to do nothing to gain their superpower . <|startoftext|> `` What ? '' asked Mary . <newline> <newline> `` Oh my gosh , I can read lips - or I can read thoughts . '' <newline> <newline> `` Hmm . '' I mused . `` Do n't tell me about all that . '' <newline> <newline> `` It 's very dangerous . '' she agreed . `` A lot of people have powers , and sometimes they 're very useful , like for saving a person from drowning , or for teleporting to another dimension . Sometimes they can add to your life . '' <newline> <newline> And yet . <newline> <newline> `` But ... '' Mary continued . <newline> <newline> `` Can you even hear my thoughts ? '' I asked curiously . `` Do n't you feel them - '' <newline> <newline> `` What ? '' she interrupted me . `` I think I can just read your thoughts . '' <newline> <newline> `` I 'm just a ... '' she stopped , then took a deep breath . `` I think I can read people if the voices are really loud . '' <newline> <newline> `` It 's true , '' I said . `` It 's very frightening , but I get the feeling that if you were to touch a person , you would n't go crazy . I 'm sure of that . '' <newline> <newline> I looked up at Mary , eyes fixed on my own face . <newline> <newline> `` Do n't you think you 're insane ? <newline> '' <newline> `` I think I 'm just ... *mad* . '' <newline> <newline> `` So ... '' she began . <newline> <newline> `` Do n't you , '' I muttered , trying to focus , '' You 're just a sick joke , I-I-I think it 's going to work out fine . I think I can read people . '' <newline> <newline> `` Is n't that what you are here
