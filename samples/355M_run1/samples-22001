 . , he said , not looking up from the window . <newline> <newline> A knock came from the door . `` I did n't expect to see you when you were n't there . '' <newline> <newline> He answered it and it seemed to be from someone in a white coat . And he was dressed in white . <newline> <newline> `` What ? No , not *me* . That 's *my* costume . '' <newline> <newline> `` I know . How did you know I was there ? It 's always confusing me so much that I have no idea what the rules are . '' He leaned back and looked at his costume , it was dark gray leather and he had painted his face with the kind of brush that only he and I ever used . *His* face . It was n't a face he showed on screen , but it did n't look like his at all . <newline> <newline> `` Ah . You must . It will be fine , please. `` <newline> <newline> `` What ? I-I do n't understand . '' <newline> <newline> `` I love you , '' he said , his voice growing deeper . He had the impression of knowing how to break down someone 's heart . <newline> <newline> He closed the door . <newline> <newline> I thought he had n't gone . <newline> <|endoftext|>
[WP] Everyone has the date they will die written on their body from birth . You 're supposed to be the first person to not have it on you . <|startoftext|> It was a beautiful day . <newline> <newline> They all looked at me on the balcony . Their eyes were fixed on my face , not too far from where they knew I lived , and the last of the summer had come . <newline> <newline> The breeze blew the white silk , making my hair fall into its folds . All people were born with some kind of a mark on their chest that marked the day they would die . <newline> <newline> For me , it read a date : March 17th , 1997 , a month after finishing college . They all looked at me and laughed and whistled and jeered at me , and I always felt very confused . I could n't take the pain of not having it etched somewhere in my back with some kind of mark . <newline> <newline> There was always a small time difference between now and then . My mother would look up from the top of my head and smile , and I 'd get a quick wink . <newline> <newline> My brother would get something else ; he would stare deeply into the sky , then get to his feet . His hand would turn me gently on its side as I lay in bed , and his eyes would look at me and ask , `` Are n't you a little too excited to be alive right now , baby ? `` <newline> <newline> They had me on my own feet , but I was also alone . <newline> <newline> A couple of minutes later , they would look at my body and laugh and thank , then they would take a deep gulp of air . They would kiss me goodbye , and I 'd then be in my mother 's arms again . My father would take his hand and be guided by her into the light . <newline> <newline> By my 20th birthday , they 'd all be gone and I 'd end up sitting in a white walled room with my mother crying . She 'd still be in a hospital bed with blood coming out , but she 'd have long hair and a few days' worth of weight . Her face would look different . <newline> <newline> No one could tell when I died . <newline> <newline> My family , friends , and neighbors would be sitting here , waiting and trying to comfort me , and the silence would be broken by the screams of the dying of old . I would be in the room at home and I 'd leave it for the next morning , and I 'd find my body in the garage . <newline> <newline> Everyone but me would be gone , and the last thing I 'd remember would be my body being in a car , somewhere . <newline> <newline> And by then , I 'd be so tired of people hating on me . <newline> <newline> I would leave her at the funeral , and I 'd leave this house and be able to sleep again , and I would start from scratch . <|endoftext|>
