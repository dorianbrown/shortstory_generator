ulate a smile but a hint of a wink . <newline> `` The answer 's staring your way , I hope . '' <newline> `` I 'm pretty sure I 'm not seeing a fucking lion . '' <newline> I turn to the security camera in an attempt to get the picture but see the man in the corner with a gun , `` Who the fuck would even get a sniper ? '' <newline> He looks at the camera and says `` I 'm on my way to a bank , what are you doing there ? '' <newline> I look confused again and say `` I was just waiting for my car . '' <newline> The man looks at me and says `` I do n't want to be caught , I just got out on the street . '' <newline> He has me down until he looks at the car , `` How did you get my key ? '' <newline> I respond , `` Simple '' <newline> He leaves , I 'm left alone in my own home . The car keys never came with me . I thought I lost all hope and that this was it . My life had been a dream . <newline> I never saw his face again , but the car keys never came with me again . <|endoftext|>
[WP] In every country on earth , everyone is under the constant surveillance of the governments . You must go through your favorite activity in the first country for each target . <|startoftext|> There was something familiar at home . I did n't know I was here . I had to get out . I had to . <newline> <newline> My name was Mark . <newline> My mom loved to tell the stories . She did n't know I was here yet . I thought this was because she was always told her story before they told her . I could feel the fear in my stomach . <newline> <newline> We moved all over the country . I 'm from New York , where the government is keeping all records on everyone . My dad lived in Minnesota , so I had to go through a lot of people . You got to know everyone . The guy you work with is a secret police officer , and then he goes . Then you go to the hospital with your mom . Everyone gets the same story or that 's the plan . <newline> We got lucky if it worked , we moved to New York where I had to stay . There I would have to be watched like a lion . And we always got to be on time . I never did meet her . I could only hear her voice . It was like she was a ghost whispering her instructions or telling you to keep moving . <newline> <newline> The other thing was I met more people . I met people I did n't know . I saw people I do n't know . The stories just kept repeating in my head , like they did n't really exist . <newline> <newline> Some people stayed in the same city . They were happy because all the new people around could see their stories unfold . Some people left , wanting to live somewhere else . Some people went places I could only dream to . <newline> <newline> I thought I knew how they managed to track me without being seen at the hospital . I 'm pretty sure I had to go . I was in California , home to an old building in the middle of nowhere . Everyone was on their best behavior , which meant me was going to be around people . <newline> <newline> I had to go somewhere safe . I had to leave , so I found myself at the beach . There I had to stay cool , so I thought about how I had to go away from my situation . Then I felt the fear of the world . It felt like I had to jump into a pit of lava . <newline> <newline> It was too late . I was in the water . I 'd never get to the bottom . It was a pit of lava . All the men and women had left already and I could only think about that day as it flashed before my eyes . <newline> <newline> *The Secret Service . * <newline> <newline> `` What is it ? '' asked Mark . <newline> <newline> `` I think it 's called an 'I can do it all '' . I had n't thought before . <newline> <newline> `` No it 's , '' replied Mark , `` There 's no real danger . I can do it all . But I ca n't do it all . They 've stopped watching the coast . I have to go far away . '' <newline> <newline> I did n't know how long we had been out in the water .
