======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 I was in the back of a cab . My hand on the wheel , I tried not to move much , and it was only ten or fifteen miles before I found a parking space with a flat meter . It was n't too bad ; nobody seemed to mind that I 'd had a ticket , but I 'd have to find a way to get back here . It had to be one of the kids taking their mother into the back of a cab , but , as far as I could tell , no one else had checked in . This was the end of the line , the line in front of me was broken . <newline> <newline> I looked down at my watch . 2:30 . No one needed to be out in this weather to do anything . I 'd had enough . I had to stop this sooner or later . <newline> <newline> If there was one thing I could tell , it was this : <newline> <newline> `` It 's about time someone learned to love the rain <newline> <newline> To stop crying and to smile <newline> <newline> The world is a dangerous place and we need to change that <newline> <newline> But if you really liked the world and if you truly thought about things that are important <newline> <newline> Then give yourself a chance , because in the end , all we have , all the precious pieces of what we were , are precious and worthless . '' It was a pretty sad thing to hear , but it had to be true . I knew she meant it , I 'd seen her say it on a few occasions . <newline> <newline> I could see it in her eyes , in her thoughts , I could hear it in her breath , so it was real , right ? <newline> <newline> `` She told you she loved you , '' I told her , `` that she loved you to know you were loved ; that 's all that she cared for you for . '' <newline> <newline> She laughed quietly , her eyes full of love . The last thing I heard for the last hour was a tiny gasp in the back of the cab , followed by the sound of a baby 's breath . <newline> <newline> The sun was setting , the whole world was going dark , and I felt I would die alone for the short but wonderful life after that . I 'd lived a few months after all of this , not knowing it I was dying alone , with nothing to do but wait , hoping I would live longer , hoping I could save a life from the rain . That had n't passed her by . <newline> <newline> `` She asked me once when I was a baby what if you were still alive ? '' I 'd asked her that morning . <newline> <newline> I had been , for a long time . I 'd told her I hoped she was still alive . I 'd told her I told her she had loved me . She 'd told me her name was Emily , and that I 'd found her while I were on a hike , and I 'd told her our baby boy 's name was James , and that I 'd run into the river where he had been and saved him . She 'd told me she had missed me again , but that I must be safe now . I 'd told her she was here , but this would have been the last time I 'd tell her it . <newline> <newline> I 'd said I 'd done it , I would do it again . I 'd told her that my little boy would be a huge, happy , handsome man , and when he would grow up he would love Emily . She 'd asked me how this happened , and I told her I 'd be there to take care of him . And then I had waited for just a few years . Then I 'd grown older . <newline> <newline> `` What if I was still here ? '' I had asked her last month . `` If we were still together ? '' <newline> <newline> She 'd been crying hard into my hands and I never saw her cry . When you 're waiting for the sun to go down , you 're always thinking about what will happen after you do that . <newline> <newline> Finally , she 'd asked me what was on my mind as I walked away from the car where we had met a few months back . I 'd had so much done just for the people I 'd met to tell her . We 'd spent a very long time together in her class , writing her essays for her classes to teach them about the classics . I 'd told her I 'd write stories about the way my father killed one of my teachers . I told her she did n't have to go
