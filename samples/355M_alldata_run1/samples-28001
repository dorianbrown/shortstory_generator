[WP] The main character wakes up in a pool of sharks . He realizes that the shark in the pool has been killed . Suddenly he is confronted with an entire world of sharks . <|startoftext|> Jack awoke , watery from drowsy , and drowsy from an acid bath . He was in a pool . He was not a shark , but he was not entirely dead either . The water was acidic , so it was impossible for him to swim . He could feel that the liquid inside himself started to acidify . He could also smell his stomach , an intense smell that was almost identical to the acid that had recently come . This was strange , but he did n't know what else to do anymore . After a couple minutes of relaxing , he went for a swim as a shark , which he could not possibly remember going . The pool was completely devoid of sharks . He was now free . <newline> <newline> He sat there pondering his life and the world that he had just left behind . He could have lived forever . There was no sense killing himself , so he could always be a shark once again . But at what cost ? He felt guilty about killing himself . He had not even known how to swim , it was an extremely awkward moment to put it into existence . So he could only swim . He started to feel light headed , but he had to stop . He had just gone for a swim , and now he was now feeling pretty dizzy . He tried to go for a swim again , but it was not working . He became more and more depressed , and had to stop . This time , he used his phone to call a shark control . <newline> <newline> When the shark control came , he felt much less afraid of the shark and felt much better afterwards . The only person to know about the shark control was a shark control . The shark control could control many sharks , so he was free to do whatever he wanted . <newline> <newline> The shark in the pool was a white lab shark with some sort of yellow eyes , a yellow skull in a pink cage , and had a white collar attached to his mouth . The shark controlled Jack , and he started to live his life . Jack wanted to stay sharkless for a bit more , but he wanted to find a new direction . He needed to find new ways to take life . <newline> <newline> <|endoftext|>
[WP] You are a super hero/villain so much that they think you 're a hero/villain . Write about their life experiences/uncounted victories/unlives/etc etc . <|startoftext|> Today was a long , long time ago . <newline> <newline> It was when I met the woman that really changed my life ( I 'm not sure if it could be considered as human , but it is ) : <newline> <newline> She 's always looking out for me and is always there for me , but does n't take me anywhere too fast , but it always leaves me feeling special . <newline> <newline> At first , I wondered why she has a habit of always working early when I go to the office , at 6 PM sharp , at a local mall in Manhattan . But now she never leaves the mall , and has to park somewhere in the back of cars , where a lot of cars are parked . I know she 's busy , but she does n't stop to look at me . And it 's strange , just like how I can n't sleep with a smile on my face . <newline> <newline> The only way to catch up with her , the only way to get back to her again , is to buy a ticket , and go to the airport to go the next morning . But to be honest , she 's a bit late . And I 'm not the kind of super that would do that . That 's why I call the super , the uber , and the super- . <newline> <newline> That 's it for today . The last thing I want to do is wait all day until I wake up to see her again , but you know I 'm not going to do that . <|endoftext|>
