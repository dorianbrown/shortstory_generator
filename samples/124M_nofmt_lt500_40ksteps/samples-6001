 and the other four remaining at our disposal. Their only regret is that one day after the fifth, they will find out that our ship's captain is also, in fact, our captain. <newline> <newline> <newline> I am not a religious person, but I have always believed that humanity's destiny was to not perish. To be humanity's slave and to never be human again. But here I stand, and can be the most beautiful woman in the world. <newline> <newline> Today I finally realized that our ship had been taken down, but my faith has remained. The captain is gone, the rest of us are now my slaves, and for the first time in my life I am free. I have already told my wife I still love her. <newline> <newline> Today I have finally seen it coming. I will not let my life be used to further my own selfish desires. So we will all come together as one common man, and I will start over. <|endoftext|>
[WP] Make the most surprising suggestion that makes the most sense . <|startoftext|> There was an old man I used to call John. He was very successful, and one of the only *really* people I knew. He was the man who taught me everything I'd learned as a child. He's always there at our house. He's always there when we need to use the bathroom and he's always there for us. He was there about a week ago now, and there is still no rest for him. I can't remember when I first found him. <newline> <newline> But it was all my good heart, all those years of good works and great success. I've watched many people in this life fade until they never had a reason to be. Then they came back. One of the first ones I saw in a life that ended in a crash and burned to the ground. He was there with me when I died. <newline> <newline> There had always been those "things," like him. The ones we would go back to. But he was gone, at least for a while. But every time we had him, he was there. With us, with us. He was in my dreams and dreams I never could dream my own. <newline> <newline> And I still can't be sure that he's gone. What does it mean to be in someone's head, to be near him, to know him, to know how to tell him he's gone? <newline> <newline> I'm not saying that this is the end of my life. It's just that I can't understand how it could happen to anyone else. There is something new and new. <newline> <newline> I haven't been back to my room for weeks, or at all. But now, I know it. The way old John used to tell us how to use the back door? That was so hard as a child. So why is he here? <newline> <newline> One day, he leaves. I walk into the kitchen and there is nothing on the floor apart from the old door, though the door was supposed to be old and he was just old. I've never seen him before, but for whatever reason he always remains at my side. <newline> <newline> He's not leaving. He'll still continue to visit his house just as I've always visited mine. <newline> <newline> Now this is different. He's gone for another day. And no one seems to be following me. I can't tell if he's waiting, or if he just left. <|endoftext|>
[WP] `` There , I have one more wish . I can have it come true . '' <|startoftext|> The cold, harshness of the world burned through her as she stood at the door. She tried to stay on the edge of her seat, and as she reached her hand out, holding her breath, she felt a strong force move through her, bringing her to the door. Her fingers instinctively began to shake and move. Her breath felt like a long-forgotten, dying breath that would surely drag her back. <newline> <newline>'What is it now? Is it your wish? ' The man asked, as she closed her eyes and closed her eyes and closed her eyes until she could hear his voice. <newline> <newline>'You are here to save her. ' He told her,'No, that can not be how it's supposed to be, if God doesn't like this we must forgive her - and if we have to then we must forgive her - ' <newline> <newline> Silence ensued, yet her mind was still. He was strong, but he could not stop it. She
