] . /r/WritingPrompts is the hub for writing . <|startoftext|> I never really had much interest in writing but I decided to take an interest in it , so , I picked up the pace and did my bit , which led me to writing for a while but as the first drafts were made , I thought I had it figured out , even if I did n't like the idea of it , I still thought it was cool , even if it 's not for me . I tried adding a bunch of little details , or adding a big piece of my life , but it did not succeed , I was unable to build up a character or even a setting , I was overwhelmed by writing . <newline> <newline> I then began to write the fourth drafts of the fourth drafts , which I thought was pretty funny , but ultimately , it was very bad . I was unable to write well enough , so I tried to make it a better comedy , I tried adding detail to the environment , I tried changing the character , it was quite difficult . <newline> <newline> I then posted them on here just after I became more and more frustrated , then posted them again on my frontpage , I am now on r/WritingPrompts , in a very short period of time , the idea has gone from `` Not the worst writing I have done '' to `` Absolutely terrible ! '' <|endoftext|>
[WP] A man stands in front of his computer with a loaded pistol . As he turns it , he does n't expect an answer ... <|startoftext|> As I started typing , I expected some kind of a response or confirmation . Some kind of `` Thank you '' or something like that . Something from myself . <newline> <newline> Nope . And nothing came . <newline> <newline> I tried it again it seemed ... Nothing I thought . Still nothing . <newline> <newline> It happened at the same time every day , the same line that came in on the screen , typed into the `` keyboard '' and never got any letters . On the screen itself was nothing but a blank line , but still nothing . <newline> <newline> I was about to start hitting enter . I did n't like the way it was . It brought more anxiety than nothing to my life . It was like someone was keeping me here instead of out . And , I did n't feel like leaving , or going home . I was like this for as long as I could remember . I was in this for the wrong reasons , I was not going to leave . <|endoftext|>
[WP] A character is stuck in a room . He wants to make a request for help , but everything is set up for him to make a bad choice . <|startoftext|> There 's nothing to do but lie there . <newline> <newline> He has n't moved since the night of the raid . Everyone knows who did it . The girl . The bastard he had been sent to get drunk and high . He 's not alone anymore . He ca n't remember how he got sent . Perhaps it was the girl , maybe it was the bastard , no no no no no . <newline> <newline> No , not now . There 's a gun in one hand and his shoulder in the other . He 's tired of lying , is n't he . <newline> <newline> `` What ? '' <newline> <newline> He looks at the gun , and a single tear rolls down his face . <newline> <newline> `` I 'm sorry , daddy . '' <|endoftext|>
[WP] You 're a high school football player , that game you took for granted is about to be won , and you suddenly lost the game entirely . <|startoftext|> I never thought it would turn out like this . <newline> I did n't think that I would end it like this . <newline> I did n't think that I could lose it like this . <newline> I did n't think that I could leave my past behind . <newline> All I could think about was how I could have done this to myself , and I would never do it . <newline> <newline> But , in hindsight , it 's probably too late . <newline> <newline> No one will forget about me . <newline> No one will remember me . <newline> No one will know this . <newline> <newline> If nothing goes wrong , it 's all my fault . <newline> If nothing goes wrong , I 'm fine with losing the game . <newline> If it was n't my fault ... it was . <|endoftext|>
