[WP] Write an extremely depressing story that makes me cry . <|startoftext|> It was a cloudy day . Not sunny like his house , but dark . Even as the sun rose , he was still asleep . The last thing he saw was the ceiling fan blowing his hair . The fan died a few weeks back , and he was about to head to work on Friday . But he did n't go because of a cold and a headache , he walked because he was tired ; and he needed a cigarette and felt bad . <newline> <newline> He pulled up his car door , but found that the driver had not been able to unlock the door . Looking around , he saw a few cars parked around the corner that he 'd parked his car . He wondered who the people were , how they were parked beside him , but he did n't see them , or rather , he did n't know how they were parked . He 's not going to make it to work because he had a migraine and did n't want to go down to Dr. Johnson 's for a headache and a nap . <newline> <newline> He pulled out a flashlight , and the lights fizzled as the light from his room flickered as he adjusted the device . He saw that he was naked . He tried to put it away , but found he had to use it just barely to block the light . He wondered why he needed a watch . He got out a piece of glass that , as he had expected , made little noise but did make noise when it slid , in between the mirrors . And the next thing he remembered was a man dressed head to toe in yellow , and shouting `` MELIEEE '' . <|endoftext|>
[WP] Instead of the opposite sex , all genders are reversed . <|startoftext|> I was about to be late to his party ... it was an ordinary sunny day , which meant that he was in his room , looking really sad . The clock read 9:48 . I was in the middle of the night , so I decided that I should do something to cheer him up .
