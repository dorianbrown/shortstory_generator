[WP] When humans get to space , a number of alien species enter the room . They have arrived expecting humans only a year has passed and the amount they have sacrificed will determine their fate . They have a little surprise for you . <|startoftext|> It was a lonely year when mankind received their first message from *Ding* . It was a long time from the moment for the first to reach a world . So much had changed since then . Humans were starting to get on the collective good , and the humans were growing more and more worried . `` I will not return , I promise . '' they whispered in fear and anger . It seemed a shame at the end , considering that we were so happy to receive this message . It would mean an end to this war , and the rest of the world would all perish . It seemed inevitable . <newline> <newline> `` It will take time . '' the first alien said `` the amount they sacrifice will determine their fate .

The amount sacrificed is small , but I will know that my message will live forever . '' <newline> <newline> The human delegation finally reached a clearing . Their ships were ready to arrive soon . It was a long trip , but we made it . `` Goodbye , my children . '' The first alien said , and we sent those goodbye . I was glad to see all of that . <|endoftext|>

He scrolled down the paper , and when he turned to flip it back to paper she was there , smiling . `` Hello , mortal ! '' the woman said from beneath the brim of her hat . <newline> <newline> <newline> He felt a strong current of fear run through him , and he ran . It was all he could feel at the moment . Something had triggered his core , which was the only form he could think about . There were many , many things that were going through his mind , and he couldnt escape them . The world was full of panic and fear and nothing but those things . His mind started to wander . <newline> <newline> *He did n't feel any of it . * <newline> <newline> <newline> The only thing that really made sense now were the words he was about to type and could n't write out . The only thing that mattered to him was making the decision , and there was nothing , and nothing short of it . He did n't want to write this out either . Because it was too late . The man before him was gone , and he had left behind nothing but the knowledge that death was coming . Now there was nothing but the knowledge that it was never coming . That there all was just one way to go <newline> <newline> The thought lingered in his mind for a moment . There did n't need to be anyone in the world to know this was all just a lie .
