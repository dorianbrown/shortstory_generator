line> <newline> “ No . Not in my presence. ” The young man continued . “ You would be my enemy if not for my presence , I was born in the same manner in which you are now incarnated . I am in your place . <newline> <newline> “ I was born without my mark . And the mark of your choice . And that which we were meant to keep intact . To protect and guide. ” <newline> <newline> `` What do you mean ? '' <newline> <newline> `` I do not know , perhaps I should explain more . I think that the world was always meant to be safe in harmony with itself . But it seemed that only in the presence of an enemy can it continue . And we were meant to keep a peace with each other. ” <newline> <newline> `` Peace ? We lost our way . So what we did was to use every opportunity to find other opponents . To force them into a state of disrepair where there was none left . Even more than ours . Now there is nothing left for us to do now , it has been forgotten for millenia. ” <newline> <newline> `` I don ’ t understand you , you must understand . It was always meant to be .

So , our first choice and our most effective weapon . But this is different . A weapon taken from another . A weapon wielded by us . '' <newline> <newline> `` And so will you give your mark to me ? '' <newline> <newline> `` This is a decision for all of us as well . And when we have a choice , I believe that whoever wields the weapon has the right to use any weapon . '' <newline> <newline> `` So where do we choose to wield a weapon ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Well , this world was meant to be . And when we do not know where we can wield it , we will seek out those people most suited to wielding it , and their mark . '' <newline> <newline> `` And , when we lose our mark , we never do . '' <newline> <newline> `` That is why I chose you . And I will fight to be your champion . And I will fight to bring about peace . And I know my mark is not going to be in vain .
