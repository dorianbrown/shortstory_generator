 of the people who live far to the east . They have been coming after me since my home was stolen and a man killed my wife . They look on their people with horror , and all in the name of some man named William . <newline> <newline> Tonight I take a walk with them , and it awakens me to the horror of their lives . I get scared . So scared . So scared . They will kill me and my children and everyone . Their hands and their souls will be spared , and the world does n't have to suffer . <newline> <newline> When I get up to the house , two of my boys have already begun to cry , and one of my women is dead . <newline> <newline> So I tell them a story . What if we do n't do anything ? What then ? What then ? <newline> <newline> We kill them . Our race has the gall to do this . Let the humans burn in the pit of the Earth . If we let them . <newline> <newline> Tonight , I will take their lives . Tonight .. tonight we shall have been successful . Let the humans burn in the world 's heart . Let it become theirs . Let it become their legacy .. <newline> <newline> We shall live , to see our children and grandchildren suffer in the agony .. <|endoftext|>
[WP] You , and the people around you , are the people of the city 's most important business and social club . You all have superpowers and no one knows who you are . <|startoftext|> `` The hell ? '' I exclaimed , confused . I was the only reporter and I would have to say someone has a super power of their own and now I just have to convince them to report this ? '' I said , as if I must . `` I 'm the guy who just has a feeling that anyone and anything can happen . Now , how am I supposed to convince them ? Do they know something ? They have n't done it . '' I said , pointing out the place I was supposed to go , in the center of the room . But then they did it for me . And it all started when I showed up as one of the club 's journalists . They all stood there in disbelief , and we both knew that I was in the way . <newline> <newline> So when it happened , I was n't too sure what to do . I was n't too sure of what to believe . I took the stairs , with the only way it has worked in the past and I jumped over the table . <newline> <newline> `` Hey , what 's wrong with that . '' I asked , not knowing if it was the reporter 's fault . `` I am a reporter . Are n't you afraid ? '' `` No , I 'm not afraid , '' I said . <newline> <newline> `` I thought you said something at the end of your last sentence . '' They looked confused . `` What ? '' I asked , trying to be as casual as possible . <newline> <newline> They all nodded . They did n't have to see me . I was fine as long as I did n't make a mistake . I had my own doubts then . So I just stood there and I went about my day . <newline> <newline> It was n't long before I started getting annoyed from the others watching the news , but that is just a byproduct of the times . <|endoftext|>
[WP] You are a time traveler who works at the front desk of a Time machine and the person beside you is talking about their time machine . <|startoftext|> `` This is John . '' I said . <newline> `` We 're dead , and you 're still here . '' John 's reply was incredulous . <newline> `` We 're dead and you 're still here . '' `` Why are you here ? '' I replied . <newline> `` Because of time travel , '' John began again . <newline> `` Well , if I 'm still here in a universe where time travel is true , then why would I want to go back in time ? '' <newline> `` I do n't understand . That 's why I 'm alive in the future . '' I said . <newline> `` You 're just being stupid . '' John said . <newline> `` You 're making the world a worse place with that damned time travel . '' <newline> `` It 's true ! It 's true ! My ancestors died , and now you are going to put me in the future ! '' I said . <newline> `` This is John . '' I said . <newline> They all started to chuckle . After a few seconds of silence
