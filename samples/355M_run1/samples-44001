 fused his own blood together with mine , and breathed it on my shirt . <newline> <newline> `` What ? '' <newline> <newline> I turned around . They were all hiding a great deal behind them , their faces had all gone slack , and their shoulders were now a dark , hollow shape . <newline> <newline> `` No , your father did not come here , '' I explained . `` He was born in Scotland , before it was struck down as unconstitutional to use the 'mock ' language there . '' <newline> <newline> `` Not that I know of , '' I admitted quietly . I was beginning to feel sorry for how the guards were all acting in that fashion : I was beginning to like it . <newline> <newline> `` I 'm sorry for that , '' they agreed at once , smiling at each other , `` and I apologise that we cannot be there together . '' <newline> <newline> `` This is not an opportunity to be alone , '' I explained . `` It should not be . '' <newline> <newline> For many years I had followed him up to the house for a 'good ' night out ' 'when I could 've spent a full night in a brothel . ' <newline> <newline> Now we were coming together . I had n't spoken to him since his wife took his children , and we had n't spoken in months . <newline> <newline> `` No , this was meant to be my marriage night , '' I spoke . `` The one you have promised , and I am going to take . '' <newline> <newline> `` Is n't that so , Mr , '' they both said simultaneously . `` I 'd love to have you take . '' <newline> <newline> It was then that I realized what was in front of me , and the only way to deal with it was to leave it . <newline> <newline> The guards , not being able to stop me from being alone , held me down . They dragged me to the gates , and I screamed , so loud and so loudly that I woke even my daughter . <newline> <newline> They held a knife , and slit my wrists . They 're never being there for that one . <newline> <newline> After their deaths they left me a letter , saying that it would be a long time before my children could get to a school of their own . <newline> <newline> My daughter would be taken before she reached her age . I could never be alone , so I shall be spending the rest of my young life in the care of the Guard . <|endoftext|>
[WP] The year is 2030 . you 're one of the last teenagers left on Earth . What do you do ? <|startoftext|> I stared down at the screen with the familiar click and drag motions of a text editor . After a few minutes , the words opened up in a font I had used for over a decade . The first thing I checked was `` last time I 'm alive ... '' <newline> <newline> The font looks like it had been used with a hundred other versions of `` Last Things You Will Ever Know '' , all of them with no error marks . The second part of the message is that I can not remember who said the text before , it says `` The most important thing you can ever do is never forget the things . '' You never forget a word . <newline> <newline> This one says `` remember . '' I glance down at the main page of the text editor , and notice that my `` last words ' were written by the same author . This means that there have been other versions of `` Last Things you Will Ever Know '' , all of them with no difference . I check again , and the last time I touched the font , it was no different from the others . <newline> <newline> Maybe it does n't mean anything , I stare up at it with blank eyes , wondering if people in the future will read this in the future . <newline> <newline> *I am a writer ... I have lived my life not being able to remember what happened before I was 15 , now that I have a memory of my life . I will never forget , * my writing was the only thing that kept me from forgetting anything . * <newline> <newline> ~~My Story starts at the beginning~~ <newline> <newline> **1:57 ~~ I woke up in my apartment complex in a dimly lit room . My heart rate increased into my throat , yet I failed to stop . *Damn , * thought the last words I would ever write . I was writing in my mind , as was most of the last words I ever wrote . My eyes shut
