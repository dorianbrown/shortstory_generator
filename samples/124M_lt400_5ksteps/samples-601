======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 ... <newline> <newline> There 's a way I can make that work again , I tried it out before now . I could have found a way to add it to my code . And I could have written the code for more of an easy way though than me . But it 's been a problem my whole life . You never really know what you 're going to get if you try something new or it starts to get boring too fast , you just can n't stand being the one who accidentally let *you* get your head around this . <newline> <newline> *Click* in the code , and see if you find anything . And then *Click* when you look in Google and look that way it will show me . <newline> <newline> *** <newline> I wrote this because I 've seen someone 's genius fail and failed in a way I did n't expect . *Click* the code that I 'm about to write . You can see my reaction on reddit and the comments from others like you . But this is the most important code I did n't write before , so if you 're wondering what I mean , I ca n't be mad at you , just let me know <|endoftext|>
[WP] Write a story when the first sentence is a word <|startoftext|> I 'd been working in an inn for years , and had heard about the power of the mind . No need to think about it . <newline> <newline> Just sit and take it upon you to do the opposite . I mean , I know how it works , I know how to change it , there were times before I met the person I knew I had to go with . But what am I going to do now ? <newline> <newline> I can do anything I want . I can change anything - it 's not magic that can change anything , but I can change everything , everything I 've ever wanted . I just 've got to do it or I 'll never know it . <newline> <newline> I 've taken it upon myself to change this all the time . And you see in stories , the people who have to change the past , the people who are allowed to stay past their children 's death 's pain in order to get to where they 've been is the hardest part . But you 'll never find me who knows why I tried . What I did this 's right . I tried to get this right . And this is your chance to see me become a better , more fulfilled man , to take control of the situation , to make the decisions . Or so I thought . I thought it was the right thing to do , to have someone who would n't be held back by fear . A world to live in now is like a world we can never forget , but you can only exist on the screen now , in that moment you could be the first living man left . I feel the air in my lungs , the warmth in my palm , the smell in my mouth , and the fear of being stuck . That is the moment where you will learn to be a better man . I never knew anyone knew me then , and I only knew who I was . <newline> <newline> <|endoftext|>
[WP] The most advanced alien civilization on Earth is destroyed in an atomic explosion . <|startoftext|> What is it you call a space colony ? <newline> <newline> I mean it 's what the Earth is . I can take anything I want , and I 'm in control . I 've got nothing . <newline> <newline> It 's about what I see on the outside when I 'm looking for that stuff . That stuff I see every day for the past 24 hours . What about this thing I see , that little thing that 'll get me out of here one way or another . That little thing will make me look into the sky and see all those tiny pieces that can only be seen by those little things ? They could be mine , but no matter . I 'll never be one of them . <newline> <newline> Let me show you the way out of here . <newline> <newline> We 've got a long corridor left of us . It 's a little too long already . I think we should start there , before we do. <newline> <newline> That 'll get us out of here . <|endoftext|>
[WP] The United States has been on a collision course with Russia since the beginning , and have always been a stalwart ally when it was only a matter of time until one of them was killed . There are currently 13 of your species living near Russia now , each of your species having lived about 2 years to a decade . <|start
