> <newline> `` Why ? Because nobody tells me to be like this . '' <newline> <newline> The old man shuffled some papers . <newline> <newline> `` So ? '' <newline> <newline> `` The same reason the people who have the time to talk are the same ones who talk every day . '' <newline> <newline> I sat next to him , but he had already sat down so I was sure I could take him . <newline> <newline> `` And why ? Why the people who talk are the people who are so predictable ! '' He stared into his eyes at an odd place . <newline> <newline> `` Because I want to think of someone else as a perfect person . I want to think of someone else who is more perfect than my own kind . '' I felt the tears welling up in my eyes . <newline> <newline> `` The people who love me just ca n't compare to the people who hate me . The people who are n't perfect because they think they are . The people who are n't perfect because they are afraid , because they do n't know what I 'm feeling . '' <newline> <newline> `` So ... we 're different people . We have to be ! '' <newline> <newline> He leaned over and whispered into my ear . <newline> <newline> `` The perfect people , that do n't have perfect ideals , that are n't perfect because they thought they were . Their ideals may not be perfect , we might have different ideals and it may be the perfect people . '' <newline> <newline> I shook my head . <newline> <newline> `` The perfect people , we can only exist because we were born to be . '' <newline> <newline> I stood up . I stood up in front of him . I knew my ideals and my way of thinking . I just wanted to be right and not make them . I felt my own anger boiling within me . But even I felt the need to hold back . I was angry now . I could hear his rage . I turned around , I saw the man standing next to me , and I remembered him . He was not the perfect person . I would not allow them to be like me . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> It 's been four hundred and twenty five days since that fateful day . <newline> <newline> I am free . <|endoftext|>
[WP] Make the saddest love story ( maybe using as many adjectives possible ) . <|startoftext|> So you 're sure she loves you , so you 're sure she could find someone she would like . But , yeah . I feel like I 've been crying . What , could it be tears , you think ? I mean , it just is n't true . Every time I think this , I feel a little bit sick . And just like that , my feelings get carried away from me until now , and for once , you do n't think I 'm mad . <newline> <newline> She never really understood . She thought things were different for me . You know , she was going through something . She would talk about life and things , but never really touch anyone else . I did n't think it was special , but she did talk when I thought she was making me cry . It 's been fifteen years , and I do n't think her emotions are really that bad . I could talk to her but she just would n't talk to me . And when I talk to her , I see it in her eyes . The way she looks at me and I see the hurt in her eyes . Her smile , her frown , her tears , she knows how I feel . <newline> <newline> I feel a little sad , right now . <newline> <newline> Why do you think I 've just fallen for her ? Because there are only so many feelings you can have on someone other than yourself . So few , and yet there is one to feel for me in so many places .
