ll , i have seen and am aware of everything the universe has to offer , all of which is a manifestation of the universe , but it isn â€™ t an extension of any universe either . A manifestation of all things that exist and are not something I know of . It is impossible to see , and I 'm unsure any of it could have been made so quickly after all the time and energy and other dimensions were created that I would ever know all the answers to all of the above questions for the entire universe itself . <|endoftext|>
[WP] What is the hardest part about writing ? <|startoftext|> No. It 's probably n't difficult . I just started to write when I was a kid , and then I started to write when I got older . But it 's definitely the hardest part , because it just takes a really long time to write . <newline> <newline> At first , I did n't really know much of the language . I was just a kid , and I was just getting started . Then I got bored with it . And now I just can n't think of anything to write . <newline> <newline> When I started to write I had a hard time keeping up with other kids . <newline> <newline> `` Oh my god '' I could hear it and then I got into it , I felt like I would just sit and watch myself and not be able to finish it . <newline> <newline> As I went on , the harder I got it was the harder I got it . <newline> <newline> That was the hardest part . <newline> <newline> I 'm just glad , I had n't figured it out yet . It 's probably the hardest part , and it probably just takes a really long time . But I do n't regret anything . <newline> <newline> I 'm still waiting for it ; I 'm n't happy . I 'm waiting for it , and I 'm still waiting for it . <newline> <newline> Just hope and pray . You may do one last thing to help me out , but I 'm going to miss you . <|endoftext|>
[WP] <|startoftext|> I felt so empty , so cold , and the memories of my life filled in the cold depths . <newline> . <newline> <newline> Everything seemed to be going well , the things that seemed to make sense to me , never once did I suspect , or care how they had gone . The feeling of emptiness , a feeling of being in a vacuum , and a feeling of failure . The feeling of emptiness , like being in a place which you 've never felt in your entire existence , where you 've always felt like you needed the help of someone , a place , and even a thing , and nothing . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> ... And then I felt my whole being ... a burden filled in by the thought that something could n't help me ... a burden I had been struggling and suffering . I would try not to get hurt or to feel bad ... I would try to go away . <|endoftext|>
[WP] Write a story for a fictional character or a real person . <|startoftext|> The person has chosen to protect me , that you would have chosen to protect me , that you would have chosen to protect me , that you would have chosen to protect me , that you would have chosen to protect me , not that you are now to protect me , for you are chosen to protect me . <newline> <newline> They say in a far off land that you must make enemies by your actions , that you must destroy their families , that you must fight them and the people they hate , because they call you an enemy , while in a far distant land a man calls you a friend . <newline> <newline> Their father , his mother and his best friend are all dead and gone , so you are the only one to have survived . <newline> <newline> They also say they do n't care , because now I am the only survivor and if there are more of us , I will kill . <|endoftext|>
[WP] In The Universe Today , on page 150 , you are `` one '' -- `` and all that matter ! '' . The world is now in a perpetual state of evolution . The universe in question is called the Universe . <|startoftext|> I thought as before that I could have done a novel on a planet , but as I approached the world 's largest and most popular website , I noticed that , on one page , you were asking `` how long do you live for ? '' The answer was simply , `` `` The longest thing
