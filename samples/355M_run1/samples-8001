My body was cold against my chest , and I felt the coolness , the feeling that I always felt from age . My eyes adjusted slowly to the dark outside . There was a slight amount of smoke in my lungs , but it was clear that this was n't the end . <newline> <newline> `` The machine ! Yes ! We 've got to go . I 'm here , and I 'll be here forever .

'' <newline> <newline> `` Who the hell do you think you 're calling to when you 're here ? You 're dead ? I know you are ... '' <newline> <newline> `` Yes . I know .
