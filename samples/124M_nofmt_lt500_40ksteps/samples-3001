ï¿½! And I was right there with it." The two began to shake hands together," I love you bro! I love you." I hugged him back for a moment and then they made peace, knowing that would be all the time I could think of before he died. As my phone rang I looked up to see my husband sitting before him from behind a white tarp. <newline> <newline> "Good morning babe, that's your best friend, and I'm so happy to share the moment with you. I love you so much!" <newline> <newline> "It would be nice if you didn't have to talk me down in the hospital, but you know, as soon as the news goes out, I can't hold anything back." <newline> <newline> "I can not handle it!" I choked on a tear and took my phone out of my pocket. There he stood up and walked out of the room. I got there and asked him where he went. For a moment I realized that I needed to ask where his parents were. <newline> <newline> "I need you to know you aren't leaving me, bro." I asked, just to show his face. "Did he talk to you in the hospital?" <newline> <newline> "No, I just told him it was okay for me to talk to him, but he wouldn't see me anymore!" <newline> <newline> "No, I just can't! That's because I don't have my phone!" <newline> <newline> "Do you have some important news to tell me? Please?" <newline> <newline> "Yeah! But this is a little late bro! And I need to go to school tomorrow!" <newline> <newline> "No! Please!" I whispered to myself. My best friend had died and I needed to share this with him. My heart was racing, there was just enough time to cry, but I was too weak to cry. I turned and sat on my side, and in a few seconds he looked up at us. "You're welcome bro," he said. <|endoftext|>
[WP] An alien abduction is happening . What are the details ? <|startoftext|> I knew it was over when I saw the blue-white spaceship. I looked around and knew what to do with my little boy. When he was on the ground he always used to be walking. He used to get lost, not realizing the whole situation. But he didn't. He used to find more strange planets and more peculiar places than we do today. He also used to visit me, not wanting me to believe him. He used to tell me every time he was home, what he needed to do for him with this new life. He was an older man now, in all his life, he thought he was special, the oldest, perhaps. <newline> <newline> But now, he is, when I saw him. My little boy, he was the same, the same as before. He had blue, red, green and white skin, like the other men I had seen. I was never sure, but I knew I must be wrong. <newline> <newline> He was the same, the same as before. I didn't even know for sure, so I thought maybe he was special, or strange. But then he used to go to the other planets, the ones that he visited and made new friends with, but the other planets were not so different. His family had a different name though. The blue-white was a bit different, but a bit more distinct as well. The boy was wearing blue on my arms, his skin was white and he had a red tail. <newline> <newline> I was right there on the ground, watching as he was taken away as fast as he could be. It was like I knew all about it, because I was in the same place and the space station was in the same place. <newline> <newline> No matter how many times I asked him "Where are you, where are you going, where do you want to go?" He would never answer. It seems as though he wasn't alone in the universe when I asked him what he wanted to do. <newline> <newline> He knew. The way I knew him. <newline> <newline> The ship had been moving for some time now and my little boy was in a small area. I made sure to have a good look at his eyes. They were so bright, so bright that I couldn't help but smile. <newline> <newline> He had blue skin. A few days ago he was in a hospital. I said he needed to go to a hospital, but I didn't know what we were talking about. I had
