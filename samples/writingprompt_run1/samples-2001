newline> <newline> “ Well then , so what should we start with ? This city is an epicenter of activity , and as all cultures , our culture was born in harmony. All of your cultures come with a certain amount of effort to spread their understanding to other cultures . ” <newline> <newline> The sun is down and the air is clear . All we can see is the white clouds in the distance . <newline> <newline> “ I am no stranger to these kinds of places so I know everything here . It isn ’ t as if I am alone and I know everything so I can not help but think about all of the people here . I can assure you that they are all here so the way they speak “ all those people said that a certain number of them were born from different backgrounds or were raised in another part of the country . The people that lived here had different types of backgrounds . Even more so than the first time I saw them and they were not here just to hear the sounds of the people singing and dancing . I saw that it wasn ’ t the people who were here from different backgrounds who were at least partially here from the standpoint of race . I see a certain amount of people who grew up here because they have other parents that grew up here . I see them growing up because I see them . I know their birthplaces because of our culture. ” <newline> <newline> “ So , what the hell ” <newline> <newline> “ Well , I ’ m afraid you are too busy . Now the best way to show off is to have us talk about what happens to all these people when they end up here. ” <newline> <newline> “ Well , that just feels nice. ” <newline> <newline> I turn in my book and see that my friend has finally finished his book of stories so that we can talk about these people . <newline> <newline> “ What is it like when you know everything before everyone else just thinks that “ is that strange ? ” <newline> <newline> I am not quite sure what I say and that was part of our first story but , I guess I just want to be sure . <|endoftext|>
[WP] The sun has finally set , and everybody on earth was shocked when they found out what caused it to go all out . <|startoftext|> The sky did not change as it always did , it was the light of the stars and the sun itself that had set . There were a few of our species that came and went , but none more than humans and other humans living in the solar system . So if they came in contact with the sky or the Milky Way at that time , they were shocked to find the phenomenon quite familiar , if not altogether surprising . <newline> <newline> They made their way to the nearest colony ship on every planet in the solar system , there was as much difficulty as one had ever experienced before , but they began to learn that they needed to make sure . They set their sights on the small blue planet they had just visited , but this was only the first of several we expected after all . The small blue planet was a massive gas giant , the size of some huge city . The creatures of the planet had their own large vessels , but they could not use them for anything other than the consumption of fuel , food , and energy . With a lot of food and a few other animals to make and animals to breed them , the creatures could not have any interest in any of it at all . <newline> <newline> One of the creatures that was a large enough population to take them in made it their only companion , and after several weeks of interaction , we were able to find a way to make sure our companions were all well behaved while they engaged in the exploration of the system , the only other species in the galaxy outside of the solar system . Unfortunately , the creature was much larger than any of our companions , and had many of its teeth cut by small hands , it was thought they were probably very lucky to be the smaller species in the galaxy . <newline> <newline> Soon , even larger creatures started being made their own , and most of this came from the blue planet . They came together to hunt and the creatures were happy , with some kind of small talk and others started getting together to talk about some small thing that had been bothering them , such as their food and their food . The large creatures started to talk about the smaller creatures that was smaller than us , even though we were small , we knew that the larger species was much more dangerous as a race . Some of the bigger creatures were taken in by strange creatures , and some of our friends started to make friends as well too . But it was still too dangerous to take in the smaller members of the species ,
