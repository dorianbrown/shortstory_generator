 to my favorite place we ’ ve known . <newline> We ’ ll get started . <newline> <newline> There ’ s someone who ’ s a bit too old for us , and someone just barely under 18 , but I ’ ve also made a good impression that I know someone who probably , by chance , may just be a girl . <newline> I always see people who look older than their age , and they do n't look very happy . I can tell . <newline> <newline> They just need to get used to the fact that we do n't care about them , and they should get used to it sooner or later . <newline> <newline> You think it ’ s a coincidence that you see people like this , but I never ask my friend Jessica to go with me . You think we only see them for the sex ? You think it ’ s just that our relationship is one sided ? <newline> <newline> Jessica is my best friend . She looks great too , like she was once a human . <newline> She looks exactly as she was then . She seems happy and energetic as she ’ d seen before . <newline> <newline> You really can ’ t blame me , if you think it 's unfair to me who cares about her . <newline> I know you don ’ t care about me either . <newline> We ’ ve been together since we were children . <newline> How did we know you were coming out ? We had already made arrangements , and you just came out . <newline> What the *hell , no one cares* ? It 's like , I don ’ t want to know the truth . I don ’ t want to know my feelings . <newline> <newline> No one to talk to . <newline> <newline> I know you think I ’ m selfish . <|endoftext|>
[WP] You live on an island , where all human contact has ceased . But you still can communicate with your friends and family ... <|startoftext|> No one in my family has ever known how I met Mr. Fredrickson . It was at Christmas : we ate all the Christmas presents together . And before I knew it , Mr. Fredrickson had been shot by an unknown assailant . Of course Fredrickson was dead , but not before we all celebrated . My mother , my father , and I all said good bye to each other in the same way . I never thought they had a family . <newline> <newline> There was one family who did have a family , though . My mother had the biggest house in the area , and we lived in the woods for months . I did n't know how we were different , or what drove me apart from them , but as time passed , the sadness and misery became far more intense . <newline> <newline> We just talked about the world . Like a normal family , we just wanted to talk about our families , and we did n't know how to share it . That 's when I learned about the Fredrickmans . They lived in the woods , and I never saw Fredrickson until he passed . We did n't know how we were separate , but when I did , I saw them . My mother was happy and smiling . The father was angry and sad . They both looked the same as before , but they seemed completely different . <newline> <newline> No one in my family has ever known how I met Mr. Fredrickson . <|endoftext|>
[WP] Everyone is immortal and the only thing that can kill them and bring them back is a simple click of the mouse . <|startoftext|> The war always begins in a way the author of the war did not plan . <newline> <newline> The war always begins with a simple click of the mouse from the author of the war , in a world where bullets, grenades , and bombs are the new weapons of war . <newline> <newline> `` What can I do now ? '' the writer of the war could not take in the reality that nothing can kill him and return ; everything is going to die . It is not his choice to die , or to be erased , or to have gone without a proper burial ... or any of it . <newline> <newline> One day , he must end himself . On that day , what must he do to bring back everything ? <newline> <newline> First things he sees when he opens the door is the blood pouring out of the bathroom stall . First blood , he finds a piece of plastic tape to wrap the bloody mess back in . <newline> <newline> `` Why did n't I think of that before going into the bathroom ?
