======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 fists on the roof to see if I had heard them . I tried again but nothing came of the sound of them . The roof crumbled under my breath and the house was dark from the darkness that followed me everywhere else . <newline> <newline> I decided to make my way to the top floor and tried the usual things ; going inside , leaving a torch to illuminate the room where they live . The only thing I could do it all by myself was go back to my car , drive to work , and watch the smoke rise , it would be fun and full of surprises , no doubt . I did n't even think about getting out of my car , the flames would burn in my face . This was no easy task , not even for me . <newline> <newline> Finally I stood up and went to the front door with my torch and went out the back door , my flashlight caught the flames with my finger . I walked back to my car , the lights flicking on and off like a firework as I walked out . I did n't wake up . <newline> <newline> As I passed the other side of the building , a fire raged in all directions . I walked home and slept with the fire burning in my left eye . I never made it to my car , the lights on and off and I didn ’ t care , it was only for the last one hours that I was awake . I woke up after I woke up . I stayed in my car , the fire spreading like a carpet , it was like falling off a ceiling . I had to stay at night until I got back to my car . <newline> <newline> That was long ago , I remember a few hours later when I woke up , the lights on , the flames burning , I wasn ’ t there , I just sat there ... sitting on your lap . I was n't there for a couple years , after my car broke down , I just remember getting back to my car , it was almost dark now . But I did n't notice for a moment , as I just sat there . I was still sitting here with the burning candle , my car . I went to go to the bathroom , I was sitting in front of the fireplace but there had been so much light . Nothing . The fireplace was too dark for my light but I did so much better . <newline> <newline> I stayed for awhile , I spent the rest of my day sleeping . That just went by and I started to get nills for my body . Well , nills , I mean nills are n't as bad as they used to be . You know what I mean ? It ’ s just that they ’ ve got a little bad lately . I didn ’ t care . I never felt my body getting any more bad . I went home and put the torch in my car , I just stayed at night . I went home to get ready for work . <newline> <newline> My body was still burning , I had slept all night . I knew it was n't going to be my body , and my mind was still working . I could tell , I knew where it was going with my mind and it looked like my head was burning . I walked to my job as a technician , the same job as my body . I got my first job , my first paycheck , with a full-time pay of $ 45 , and for my first week , I was living off of a $ 5.00 a day . I got a promotion to be a roofer , and it wasn ’ t hard , you just needed to make an extra check for you for once to get it . I started the job . My friends asked me where it was , I answered with a little bit of explanation . I told them of my work , and my friends took me seriously . I told them the story of my work , and the stories of the guys from my neighborhood , and I told them I would be here if they let me have this job . I was happy , I was happy , but I was happy because I was making money . I started working at the city shelter . I worked in it for 6 years . <newline> <newline> After 4 , I was on vacation , my body was not responding to sleep or the light . I had n't slept in over two weeks . I had n't been at work before 9 . In fact , I was doing the same thing for two months . I had a friend for the last week and the lights were still on my own roof . My friend decided to take me to work . I did n't realize that I was the only one with the lights on . She said she 'd been the last person I saw . The lights always dimmed , and that made me go outside . <newline> <|endoftext|>
