[WP] The world is n't perfect , everybody just got a little too busy . One way or the other I am being reminded how the world works . <|startoftext|> The light began to brighten , and he could almost see in the shadows , the shadows were in their dark place . He looked up at the ceiling of the tall building . She was a very dark girl , with dark hair and dark brown eyes , he knew that her eyes were very sensitive . Yet , he could n't take the hint from her , not until one morning the lights had returned , this would be his last day , he thought , thinking and he would try to forget about it . In this way , he was more relaxed . It was a beautiful dream , one that he had been dreaming about as long as he had had remembered what it was like to be alive .

He thought that could n't be true . It was just another dream . <newline> <newline> `` I love the fact you know that my mother will die , please '' . <newline> <newline> `` Yes , but she was a very dark girl .

She died in a car accident and was taken by a bus , there 's not much I can do for her but let me tell her about the pain her dad left her . '' <newline> <newline> `` So , I do think that this is a life well lived . It 's not like I can tell you why you 're here ! '' <newline> <newline> `` You 're coming home . '' <|endoftext|>

He had lived a long life , a lot of it , and a lot of it had just happened . He had loved the world , had slept with the women of the world , had done some things he liked that were not in his taste , that were not for him . There had been many people , the world was very well aware of the fact his work had affected them , but it had been his last before it was finished . <newline> <newline> He had never loved so much more than an afterlife filled with life as it had been for the people of this universe , his loved ones had left him alone . It had been a long walk for his work , but it seemed to be nearing its end . He felt the ground tremble with each step and felt the sun rise , the air fluttering in the wind and the air falling and falling away . <newline> <newline> He reached to his knees .
