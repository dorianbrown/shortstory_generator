======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 fix the clock . I had to get up in the morning and go down to the park , where I was supposed to stop for lunch . It was already after 8:30 , and I would need to get back to my work after my lunch break . Not for 3:45 . Or 4:45 . I was so hungry . My brain started to feel sick . A cough just started , and soon enough it felt like a fever . I wouldnt get the headache for a few hours ... <newline> I had finally gotten back up to my computer . I clicked on the `` Sleep '' icon . My dreams came back , and I felt relaxed again . The clock had just been replaced with the familiar `` 4:45 '' . I sat down and clicked on `` sleep '' , and then the dreams happened . I felt tired , and my brain tried to get me to sit down and stay conscious . That was when I woke up , and it was still 2:45 . What the hell am I doing here ? I looked around the room , and it seemed like a giant ball of angry red with flames growing around it . My eyes widened . A horrible smell filled the room . A single tear formed , and slid down its forehead . I ran to the bathroom . I cried . <newline> The room was now an exact clone of my apartment . I ran to a mirror and saw that the room was in perfect likeness with my room . The only thing that made it seem a little strange was that I was in a pajama pants and a tanktop . In fact , I was all white , and a full red head was in the background . Everything seemed to fit . I slowly put my head back down . My mother got into my arms and was hugging me as if I was in a dream . I felt my eyes adjust to the room , and I felt like it was n't real , or at least it was if it was . <newline> I slowly slid my eyelids back closed my eyes closed . I woke up to the familiar noises of my mother going upstairs and yelling my name . A faint red light lit the room . I opened my eyes , and looked out . It seemed like a beautiful world . A world that my mom could n't see . It was amazing to see them in such a simple way , even in the horrible circumstances I found myself in . I opened my eyes , and looked around . It seemed like a very beautiful place . The grass had green trees and flowers and grass on every inch of the lawn . All was still . I had become a true child ... I could finally get to spend some time with my mom . <|endoftext|>
[WP] You live in a world where the last year of Reddit voting has determined the winner . Unfortunately , you have yet to vote . <|startoftext|> I was n't expecting it to happen so soon , but as soon as the first ballot popped in to the mailbox , I knew the stakes were going to be higher . *Why not wait for one year ? * I thought , as a thought raced through my mind . <newline> _______________________________________ <newline> <newline> What if the ballot said something about the world 's future ? <newline> <newline> It did say something about the past , but did it say anything about 2016 's results ? I thought about how I had gone on vacation with my family , and that my first ballot had to include something about those years away from my friends . <newline> <newline> But I thought : *What if I go back to the past and find my first ballot in the same box , and what 's the first year that I voted ! * <newline> <newline> As a thought of this , I remembered that I had a Reddit ID . I clicked on the link , and looked at my results : *8.66 % ... That 's pretty good , I thought . I should go back to my friends and see if they voted for him in the future , and see if I could get in to that percentage . **Click** I had made it this far through my first year of voting , so I had made the time . I checked reddit.com , then remembered that time had come , I was almost at 100 points away from this year . It was only 2 weeks away , and I went back to vote . <newline> <newline> **Vote for Donald Trump to be elected president . ** <newline> <newline> I clicked down to see what year it was , and saw a message saying `` You can not vote for Trump , you will not be allowed to vote '' . I knew then that this year would be different . I decided to go back to my friends and see if I could find a way to vote . After voting , I saw a message telling me , **You MUST vote for Trump . You will not be allowed to vote.** I looked up to see a picture
