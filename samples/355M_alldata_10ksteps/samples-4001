 no . <newline> <newline> “ I ’ m sorry , ” said the boy , with the utmost sincerity . “ What did I do ? ” <newline> <newline> “ I just wanted to get away from being stuck in the same room as a wall . I had to let you go. ” <newline> <newline> “ Well , I guess it ’ s time to go . I hope you all have a nice time today. ” <|endoftext|>
[WP] You 're a vampire . But that 's not the only power you have . <|startoftext|> He had been staring at his reflection for as long as I could remember . As I approached the end of a hallway he turned to me , the blood on his chin . “ I miss you , ” he said . <newline> <newline> My eyes widened . The hallway was warm , the color of the marble walls . This room was the perfect setting for a vampire . It was perfect , too bad I only had the ability to dream . “ I miss you , ” he said . <newline> <newline> He had been staring at his reflection for as long as I could remember . As I approached the end of a hallway he turned to me , the blood on his chin . <newline> <newline> <|endoftext|>
[WP] Humans live happily for a few years . We have a long term , extended love and affection with each other , we then come together in a community . We meet again , and we both share a mutual dream . <|startoftext|> Today was his birthday . He always celebrated it . But today , he felt nothing . All he was thinking about was himself and his thoughts were drowned in the empty darkness he had created for himself . He had done everything he had been able to do in his life , but today he was only thinking about the present . <newline> <newline> He had been sitting at the park for a few minutes when he had started to feel down and out of breath . He hadn ’ t thought of his kids , his house , his work , nor this , but today he just sat there thinking of himself . <newline> <newline> He had never been really close with his family , but he had known them all his entire life . He had been the only one to hold their affection for over ten years now . Every conversation that took place had been about him . Every kiss , every hug , every day he saw his family that they would make him proud of him . <newline> <newline> A small twinge of sadness came from his heart when his head slid down to the level it was at today . That ’ s how long he had been sitting down . That night was spent with his family , but in his thoughts the whole thing had been completely gone . He didn ’ t think of himself because he couldn ’ t think now . He didn ’ t think because his head was down . Or from the exhaustion he had had in the park he thought of himself just because he didn ’ t think of himself . <newline> <newline> He had been here in this park for four years , and he was exhausted . At one third of his stride he felt the warm air around him as he tried to remember his day . Today of his last day he had started to miss him . It was his birthday and he had already lived two years so , maybe he missed him . Maybe he hadn ’ t really . It couldn ’ t be him . It couldn ’ t be him . He had never lost any friendships or acquaintanceships . He had spent too much time in the garden , or the grass , or sitting outside at a nearby park . He had never seen his family , not even his girlfriend or his daughter . He had never lost any of his relationships with his wife or any of his family members . But today was the worst . He had lost his only relationship to his children . He had fallen in love so deeply with them that he had never once looked at them . He had forgotten them , forgotten them in such a beautiful way that he had never thought about them in the same way before . <newline> <newline> He knew he was sad that they weren ’ t there . He knew that they were his friends … he had forgotten them , since he never thought . He had thought about them , but he couldn ’ t think of them . He had thought of them all the days that he could remember , but now he couldn ’ t think of anyone else ; they all weren ’ t there . He realized then that they were gone forever . That they had to go , because there was no one else to take them with . But there was something inside that was different , something so deep and so strong
