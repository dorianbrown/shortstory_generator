======== SAMPLE 1 ========
newline> <newline> It was the dawn of a new age where he was known not as the 'Black Swan ' , but he was n't sure about that . He was on his way to his final destination . He was going to go to the moon with his family , but they did n't have the money to give him a ride home . It seemed like a fool 's errand for him . He was on the verge of breaking down and his family were already at home . So he left now , with them and his family . He told his family of his plans , and they all said yes . <newline> <newline> It was the night of the wedding . The ceremony took place at a castle . The whole city was gathered , waiting for one man , no one really knew who he was , or who that meant . It was raining , it was cold , but it was beautiful and the crowd was full . This was it for him , the man that people told him would be the greatest man any of them had ever known . And there he stood , in that night , and there he sat , the man they told he was , in that castle that day they said they would never forget . That 's how he made the leap , his final journey to the moon , when it was all of a sudden that someone else came back , and told him of the future , and his story started again . <newline> <newline> It was dark at night . And in the storm outside there was a voice that spoke to him , but it was no longer there . It was cold as well now . <newline> <newline> As he sat there , in the storm outside , in the castle , listening through the storm , still in the dark of the night , he looked at his family . His family , his family that they told him would never forget , and his family that they told him would never forget . This was his last stand . This was the last story they told him , but he could n't believe it . A man told him that he could , and that it all went too far . And he saw his family , and he could n't believe it . He wanted to tear them down . But he did n't want to let them go because he was the perfect man for that , he was the one that would have told them . He did n't care , or could n't imagine what they would have told him . But he was the one . <newline> <newline> He knew not who he was . And the one that came from the heavens to tell him of his purpose he would never forget , told him that the moon 's so bright in the clouds that 's what it is . That 's why he made the leap . It was because he felt that it could do better than this , could make his whole purpose to be a better man more complete . And he 'd decided to be a better man . He 'd be better , he was better . And what would that be then ? What would it be . That 's what he 'd come up next . <newline> <newline> He went to the moon to the city in the sky that was called as the world was . In the city he looked up , and saw his family , his family that would tell him to make a leap , so that he could leave his family behind and have his entire life be completely forgotten . He would never forget that . That 's where he made his final decision to become a better man . He left his family behind . They 'd told him about the future , and told him that he was coming home to his family . And now he was back on his home to make his last decision . He had chosen and made the leap . He would do right by his family and take care of everything , and in doing as much as he did he would never forget . <newline> <newline> He 'd come back , and he would take care of everything , so that his family would never forget that he 'd been gone . He would never forget her . He would never forget the people around him . And because that 's the kind of man he was , in his final hour , in this end , that 's what would make his family 's dreams come true . <newline> <newline> <newline> This has been a short post . I 'll be doing some type of writing prompts for other stories later . <|endoftext|>
