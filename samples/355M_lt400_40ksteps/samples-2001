 nend your tale . '' <newline> <newline> `` You 're a nice , handsome guy , and you get a lot of men. I do n't blame you , you have a lot to be annoyed by in the way you treat people . It 's what made you to rise to heights that others could not accomplish , yet you were always a great deal further from the goal than you could ever imagine . '' <newline> <newline> `` Good evening , your honour , I was just playing with my kids , '' I was dressed in a business suit with a shiny coat on my neck . That 's how I looked before I went to sleep . <newline> <newline> `` You 're a nice guy and you 've always seemed to respect others . And you do n't care though . You have only got one goal in your life . You 've just got to find the one that is the hardest to reach even after you have already overcome everything . To me , you are the biggest human being alive . '' <|endoftext|>
[WP] Make me cry even stronger than I already am . Tell me how the protagonist will be feeling when the end comes . <|startoftext|> I stood there watching that damn stranger , in the kitchen . He was still breathing that one minute in and I knew that my life was not yet over . I looked at my hand , where I had just given him a few hundred bucks because my boss wanted me to , wondering why he was so uninterested in finding out the truth . <newline> <newline> If I had n't handed the money over to him , my life could have turned out a lot differently . He may have gone into work . Maybe we would have even made some sense . <newline> <newline> I did n't think he cared that much what I knew , but what I knew was that he cared a whole lot . I was so desperate , my wallet and all , that I gave him my most precious possession . A pair of glasses . <newline> <newline> He was n't sure of the effect my gift would have on him , but I could tell that he would be willing to give me up for a pair of glasses . <newline> <newline> The thing that would change his whole life . <newline> <newline> <|endoftext|>
[WP] Everyone has a `` superpower '' <|startoftext|> That 's not how the story was written . The protagonist was born with an exceptional talent and the author tried to make it something that looked more than that in order to make it so . Maybe you can see why I ca n't . <newline> <newline> It had to be something that would allow the guy to do anything , even be able to stop the world . That 's the thing that makes my writing so difficult to read . Everything on the page just makes sense unless you do n't understand it . Maybe that 's true for everyone , but the person is more in charge than either of us . We spend 90 % of our lives reading the same thing over and over . <newline> <newline> The world is not a monolith that can be looked upon in isolation with one glance . It is that which we all possess in spite of all the choices made as individuals over what to do with it . When we look at the world from one way , it would just be a picture , like this <newline> <newline> What we can do is we can choose what to do . That choice becomes our fate and it is the world and the fate that shapes us as we choose our path . <newline> <newline> I think it is not that our power is to be the first . We can do anything we want to without being constrained by any idea of what it will do for us . We are the one who chooses it . We can choose to be the last . <newline> <newline> It is an existence of the mind , the mind to be the world . We simply have a choice , what is it ? There is so much power in the thoughtlessness , I think it is why the world is such an incredible place when it is not being destroyed as it is . If you can be like that world , and be something more than we can , then you would really be loved . <|endoftext|>
[WP] Write the letter to you that you always wanted and it still isnt good enough <|startoftext|> To my beautiful mind , my beautiful self , <newline> Thank you , <newline> My heart is filled with sadness . <newline> I will never find solace in a good book . <newline> I will always remember I did not come with the promise . <newline> I felt it , <newline> That I
