 snow. My eyes locked on the ground. I couldn't see the ground ; I couldn't see if *he* had a hole in the ground. I had to get the hell out of here! <newline> <newline> I started to crawl towards the ground. I could see some small patches of metal, the metal was shiny with copper, it was as if its made of copper. I kept coming. That was the only way I could find the earth before I died. <newline> <newline> As I slowly crawled toward the ground. I heard some scraping from behind but it was silent. <newline> <newline> I slowly crawled towards some metal. I heard more scraping, and the metal started to glow. I felt myself getting smaller. Then I saw a light. As the light faded, I saw my family, the only ones I remembered. They were still crying. <newline> <newline> I was slowly dying now. <|endoftext|>
[WP] Your child just came of age and says hi to you , `` do n't be shy . You 're not going anywhere . '' What is this kid like ? <|startoftext|> "This kid just came of age for me..." Timmy says to me as I sit down at a local diner. "I don't even know how you even came of age, even if you did, it wasn't the same way you are. <newline> <newline> <newline> "Oh hello?" I turn around to see the kid staring over my shoulder. I can see him holding his arms up, and the back of his head is still smiling. I've never seen a child face before. He's shaking like he used to as soon as he saw me. "You know, this kid is the same way you are, you see him with no friends..." Timmy is going dark now. "I miss you..." "Well that kid just said it again "you're not going anywhere" and it was just in his head. This kid didn't even look back in his head for like 5 minutes. "Do you hear me?" <newline> <newline> <newline> "I... no" I have no idea how these kids like this kid, or the kid, know what the real answer is. There has to be someone else inside and out. And I guess I've already gone from the most innocent kid to the most evil one. <newline> <newline> <newline> "I don't think you're being very careful, your kid is talking in a language I don't understand. Your kid has been talking with you since you were a kid, and he will keep talking the same words. I don't think you can stand this "kid" anymore." I try to look him in the eye, to no avail. <newline> <newline> <newline> "Why?" <newline> <newline> "... because this kid talks to you in a language other than your own. What he wants is more than anything." <newline> <newline> <newline> "Then what is this kid talking about? What is this kid like?" <newline> <newline> <newline> "I'm coming to help, I'm just going to tell him something, it'll help make him talk to you. Tell him my name again, but tell him I'm coming too!" <newline> <newline> <newline> "Hello?" <newline> <newline> "Hello?" <newline> <newline> <newline> "Okay." <newline> <newline> <newline> "Hello? I'm here? You? Can I help you?" <newline> <newline> <newline> "Sorry... It's okay. I'm not scared." <newline> <newline> <newline> "I'm not scared" <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> I can't go on to anything. I'm tired, and I'm not here to stop this. I should have listened. I just took what all the other kids say can help them. Why is this kid here? I'm too late. I'm going to find something. Someone will find you in the future. <|endoftext|>
