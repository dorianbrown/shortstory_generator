 They 're going through the same things over and over again , but this one happens to have a couple of `` weird looks '' ... . <newline> <newline> And what I do get is a blank look from some of the crew : <newline> <newline> `` We 're not interested in the whole 'you get what you pay ' thing . We are n't interested in giving up your seat and taking the seat we have and then sending it back to Earth but it 's your time . Just think about it . Now take a seat and get out of there before something terrible happens to your first week on the job or you might not get out of that situation any time soon . '' <newline> <newline> `` Sure , but how ? '' <newline> <newline> `` I do n't know , maybe we 'll just have to change the name ? '' <|endoftext|>
[WP] A man lives with all his dreams <|startoftext|> In life dreams . No one should ever assume that a person can have all of them . There are some who dream of living forever . However , we all dream of being a man , and that is our own way or the one that we know from our past . The only way we can tell which is true or not is if you 're a man or not . <newline> There are many who have lived a life , but they have never met me , nor have they ever met their dreams . They live in two worlds , and yet dream of a future where they can have as many options as they want . What is the difference though , if you are a man ? What does it matter if you want to live longer , or if you want to be a man and a man is different ? There are countless people like me , but those two things are not the same . In a sense , neither of them can be real , and I know the difference . <newline> What I wish to talk about , is when the dreams come to me . You have to have some kind of a life , and that means there is no dream , no one else matters . You can dream about how life works , but you can not create anything from there . As a man who lives as a man , I wish I could have all of those dreams . In reality I have no dreams . I can have none . <newline> See this is an essay for a book I am writing but I have no idea what I 'm leaving out , so let me know what I can do . I hope it helps you . I hope you are able to continue writing and to use it to help me as well as help improve . <|endoftext|>
[WP] Write the story of a cat who lives in an alien invasion scenario . Make humans all the alien 's . <|startoftext|> I watched her as she walked through the garden , her yellow skin a pale pale blue . His fur was soft but thick , and she knew he was a creature of habit . She tried not to notice how many fruits , nuts , and vegetables lay on all across the garden , from grass to trees to fruits and vegetables . She could smell the flowers and the fruit ; she had n't smelled them on many occasions . The food was different from the place , though . She could n't quite tell where these fruits of habit came from ; she had always thought they were from the earth . <newline> <newline> <newline> Her fur was soft , her eyes were white , and she wore a dress that was tied together in a pattern that reminded her of the way the seasons looked . Headed in the breeze , she could smell her own scent , though hers was still strong . With a quick glance , she was able to distinguish where the air had come from . The smell was more comforting , and the smell of other stuff came with it . <newline> <newline> <newline> Her fur was short , and she wore a coat that reminded her of the colors she had in her hair . Her hands were covered by a blue velvet blanket that was made of the same material she wore . She sat on the sofa and looked at books that she had brought back from the war . Her hand rested on the end , the cushions creaking with the effort that her fingernails were planted on the cushions . Her ears pierced the air with the scent of her breath from her nostrils . <newline> <newline> <newline> Her skin was brown ; her hair was dark ; her face looked as if a snake had been snuggled under it 's hide . She sat on the cushions , resting it comfortably on her back . Her tail curled up and she snuggled in close to me . <|endoftext|>
