 : It took the scientists some time to find the location . After all the tests , the scientists have yet to come to their conclusions . However , their findings reveal that this device will soon become obsolete . <newline> <newline> They had spent the better part of the last century investigating the device before the great power switch went off . The scientists had realized for some time that the time for such a thing had passed . Now , they were back on some distant planet ; a continent far away . Yet , they had long gone to the distant world . <newline> <newline> The scientists made their way back to their distant home . In their time of need , the scientists decided to return to where they discovered the technological marvel of the device . And so , humanity began its conquest upon the sun 's surface . <|endoftext|>
[WP] You are a regular guy with a few drinks . <|startoftext|> I 've been drinking for a while now and I 've gotten a feeling for the future . Maybe a glass of water will do right the ship to this new era ? Maybe a bowl of cereal instead of rice and pasta ? Maybe a soda ? <newline> <newline> I always liked to take my beer to the kitchen . I liked to take it home and take a trip to the park instead of a park . I went down on one of the trees and took a walk . I got on the tree and took a look at the tree . <newline> <newline> It wasn ’ t exactly the same but then I ’ m thinking about this . If I could go back to the water fountain and take my beer , I think I would . If I drank it for only a few days , I would still be here . If I drank it for only awhile to get drunk or make out on the beach , I would still be here . <newline> <newline> I decided to take a different approach , taking my beer instead of the water fountain . I did not take my beer as I drank the water at the fountain . <newline> <newline> I looked up at the water and began to drink it as I drank it . <newline> <newline> The fountain was hot . It was so hot I smelled like a very old person . I would smell like a very old man and the sun was shining . My stomach hurts . <newline> <newline> It was hot at the fountain , but hot in the sun . <|endoftext|>
[WP] You wake up with a heart attack . <|startoftext|> `` I 'm really looking forward to watching the movie '' I said to myself . You see , I have never seen a movie as tragic . I 'd been told before , I had been so sad that I was going to die , not sure why , but if it did n't make sense , it probably would n't have made my eyes bleed . <newline> <newline> `` Sorry , '' I said to myself . `` My heart is racing too much . '' I smiled a little . `` Are you sure ? '' <newline> <newline> This is the most awkward feeling I 've ever seen , but the thing to me is the same as every other feeling I have because of it . I had been so lost in so much , but I knew that just this moment would have me in life . So , I kept trying to think of what would end it . For the sake of my life , I decided to make it easy . <newline> <newline> I opened the movie - there 's a villain from my favorite film - and watched as the villain died . Everyone knows how terrible that is but it makes me wonder when I watched it . Was they expecting a sad hero like me ? Was he a villain ? I do n't know , maybe he will die in the movie . That wo n't end well if that was the scenario , but I guess it wo n't matter . <newline> <newline> I was thinking back to all my movies about the most sad , terrible people , but I decided this would be the most fun story I 've had to show all of them . I 'm so excited for seeing who the villain is , who the villain is n't , but I want to see the villain die the last time I saw the villain . I guess I should probably get to that one before I 'm done with the movie . <|endoftext|>
