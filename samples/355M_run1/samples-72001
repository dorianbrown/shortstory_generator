 true . '' The boy was not an angry boy . He had always been quiet , and the boy could almost feel his heart beating . <newline> <newline> He was no longer laughing hysterically , his face grew stern . He let out a long long sigh , and began to nod . <newline> <newline> His father stared at the other boy , his pupils shrinking . <newline> <newline> `` It 's alright , child . We had to deal with this for the right reason . I did n't want you to grow up and become a killer , and now he wants you to kill ... . '' <newline> <newline> The boy was not a killer . He was still just a child . He had just been taken from his mother . He still had n't met his father , but they had talked . They had talked about the pain he had gotten from being taken from his mother ; how it was all just a punishment to the one he loved and the girl he was supposed to be married . <newline> <newline> He thought he had thought all that through . His mother was a beautiful woman , with a promising future . He thought this over for a long time before finally agreeing . The next few months had been very hard for him . He had even gone to a psychiatrist because he felt that something was still holding him back , holding him back from reaching his full potential . <newline> <newline> He was finally ready to say goodbye . It had been hard for him , but he had learned to accept it . His dad was right , the pain he had gotten from being taken had already been taken . The pain and suffering had finally passed with him . He would spend the rest of his days alone in his bed , looking after his family , watching over them . He imagined this in his head as he went out . <newline> <newline> The boy turned to go . The boy did n't even notice until he started to walk away . Then he turned to his parents . <newline> <newline> `` Hey , kids . See me later . I was a good boy . They thought I could be better ... I could be the bad guy ... '' <newline> <newline> But he was n't . The boy looked over to his two older brothers , and they knew exactly what that was going on . <newline> <newline> `` Hey , son . I 'm proud of you . I 'm glad ... I had the choice made for me ... but I would have taken the easy road . '' <newline> <newline> He turned away , and walked into those same empty eyes to the end . <|endoftext|>
[WP] Write a story that seems perfectly normal and normal , but completely alters every observation you make . <|startoftext|> He was not a young young man . He was not old . He was not wrinkled . He was not ugly . He was nothing of whom one could say . His family was small . And there he was , holding the sign , and it spoke out , <newline> <newline> *He will be a great man you will marry* <newline> <newline> His family was small . <newline> <newline> His family had been together since they were children , he loved them ; even the most petty crimes .

[WP] You wake up one morning in possession of the ability to control any human emotion through signs and music . You can go anywhere , do anything , and it will be affected by your choice of music . <|startoftext|> He was no wizard or a witch . He was born knowing nothing of the wizardry complex . He studied at night to learn , and practiced his ability all the time . Then , he would move a bit or a little , and he would feel the presence of his surroundings , and the emotions they felt . He could make a humming sound , and a loud bang . But , he would always be in his spot in time , at just the right moment , as though he was sitting under the blanket . <newline> For example , a day passed when he was doing a very impressive trick , and he felt the presence around him when he performed it . This was very unusual : he had previously never felt anything around him . He had never experienced anything so subtle . `` Good . '' <newline> He never wanted to make mischief , although he always was able to . His parents often teased him , because he only danced around in his place . <newline> He had always enjoyed music , and it would always help him .
