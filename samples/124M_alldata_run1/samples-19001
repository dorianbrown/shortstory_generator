 her eyes closed , she would be alone for the rest of her life and it would all be okay . <newline> <newline> `` You 're all right , '' said James . <newline> <newline> `` Yeah , like I said ... I 'm okay '' said Sam `` Now come on . I 'm so sorry I 'll see you later . '' <newline> <newline> `` That 's fine , I 'm here '' said James . She had a nervous smile and kissed his cheek . <newline> <newline> James ' mind was still racing , he had the feeling he was just going to sleep . Then it hit him . <newline> <newline> `` Mommy , can I stay over here ? '' he asked . <newline> <newline> `` Yeah that 's a good idea , lets go to the other dorms . '' she replied , and she opened her eyes and hugged him , he was a real cool person as well . <newline> <newline> `` Come on , stay with me ! '' said James , and she kissed him on the forehead . <newline> <newline> The two slept together for hours in the back of the house , his body was cold on his lap , he did n't even like her . <newline> <newline> `` We should go to the library when you 're older . Or the library ... it has to be like this '' said James . <newline> <newline> `` It 's okay , just let me stay here , and we can go to the car if you need me . '' said Sam `` The library is just like mommy . Do n't let me stay , I will be out with you . '' he said . <newline> <newline> There was still a few minutes before James and Sam were out , and both had some lunch of their choosing . <newline> <newline> There was nothing to eat , the house was still empty , save for the books , so they must have packed everything for a last minute getaway . <newline> <newline> It was almost eleven , and they were finally outside . The sky was bright red , they were finally home . To the world . The car was gone , nothing there but a small box of paper . <newline> <newline> `` Where was your Mom again , '' said the voice from across the car . It had a strange tone but somehow it had a pleasant tone for a car . <newline> <newline> `` And to your family , '' said the voice . It was a young voice with a very friendly way of speaking but it was not all that nice . <newline> <newline> James could not understand what it was . He was so new . <newline> <newline> James felt his head spinning `` Please ! '' he shouted . Tears began falling from his eyes . <newline> <newline> `` I forgive you , '' it said . <newline> <newline> `` I forgive you too , I was just about to leave you and mommy , to go back , '' said James <newline> <newline> `` I love you , '' it said in a happy voice `` I understand , because I 'll never know if you 're still around , and then we both get the same chance I never had in my life . '' <newline> <newline> `` Thanks , '' said James . He knew this was a mistake and he looked at the car as he reached for his pocket knife . The knife was small but seemed bigger than he had ever seen it before . <newline> <newline> He opened his eyes and the knife was on some of the books . <newline> <newline> `` I love you too , '' he said before leaving . <|endoftext|>

I couldnt believe I felt so empty in my tiny little apartment . <newline> I made my way to the local coffee shop , the girl was having her coffee too , I didnt have any left , and I didnt dare approach her . The woman looked rather annoyed , and in my head I saw the signs of a divorce . <newline> As I sat down , she took the cup and left me . I felt sad then , the world was ending .
