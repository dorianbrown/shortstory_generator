 cleaning the room . That we needed to move . The man who was there in the last night had returned . He was young and dressed in what seemed to be a uniform . He ran towards the man and demanded his return . <newline> <newline> `` I want to get to the station ! Send another guard ! '' We turned around . The man said nothing and let out a silent scream as an older woman in military uniform ran past the cell and opened the door . We rushed in , yelling , until I was able to see her . She was in a red dress with two men lying motionless on the floor . One was handcuffed behind him . They looked at each other and at my cell and it was in the same spot I was waiting in . They came closer . I could n't make out the look of fear in my own face but I saw fear . The room was filled with screams now . In shock I could see his eyes , that were red . I saw his arms move , not in a good way . I noticed his body was a ball of fire but I felt no pain . I moved towards him and held a knife to his throat . I felt nothing , no need to be afraid anymore . I let go but the pain took me . I went to the table I had brought out and I removed the gun from it . The older woman grabbed the gun but I dropped her but I did n't notice before they started shooting . I saw the first of her shot hit the first man , she was able to move but as the second man fell she was unable to . The man fell backwards killing him before me . <newline> <newline> `` That was my first time getting shot . Sorry if anyone did this , this is my first time and it was my first death . '' <newline> <newline> I have to go . I can not let them shoot me anymore . The only chance I have left is the guard . I need to leave now before the rest of the guards make it before I go . If I lose this I do n't have the chance to live . I 'm going to die . I love you my brother , I miss you all in front of me <newline> <newline> The girl fell back to the ground , clutching and crying at her wrists . <newline> <newline> The two men turned to each other and said `` I love you mom , I think a family was out for a smoke break . '' <|endoftext|>
[WP] On your eighteenth birthday , you shoot an arrow into the sky , telling the world what you 're going to show them . Twenty-three days later , it starts to move . <|startoftext|> No sooner was it going to start then when the arrow hit my left shoulder . `` What the heck ? ! '' I was too scared to even speak my mind . I had already hit the roof . <newline> <newline> In five minutes a small black craft landed with a loud ringing in the distance . <newline> <newline> I looked down to see my friend on the ground a couple of minutes after the arrow had hit the ground . There he was laying , bleeding heavily on the pavement . He just blinked at me with wide eyes wide in amazement . <newline> <newline> `` Wow , what the hell ? Where the fuck did you find that arrow ? ! '' <newline> <newline> The man in terror was so puzzled by what he saw that he managed to look straight ahead . He was standing on the street , head down and hands holding onto the shotgun he had just taken out in the street . <newline> <newline> `` There was no way I did n't see the arrow . '' <newline> <newline> Looking up he continued reading the paper the man scribbled onto his paper with a quiver in his mouth . <newline> <newline> `` It 's not the arrows of course , the arrows do n't always teleport to the right location and then go back to my house . I do n't even know where they go or when they teleport . I just figured I 'd be able to figure it out . '' <newline> <newline> The next next day he came back from work . `` Looks like there 's a strange glitch in your house , does n't it ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Yeah , it did n't make any sense . I did n't see anything weird about it . '' <newline> <newline> I felt the urge to be creative . `` How do I explain this ? '' <newline> <newline> The man quickly went back to the paper and started fiddling with the paper . <newline> <newline> `` It 's weird that this arrow was just made for that exact reason . But not why I was thinking about it . How
