 ' . I had never seen him smile . I guess I did see it . I mean...I *am . *And* I thought it must be my own imagination . I tried not to smile . My eyes were too hard . I 'm sorry , *myself* . I 'm not your son . My mother never gave birth to me . I thought she 'll live another day . I do n't think she did either . I want out . I do n't want to be here . I want out and not be here . I want out . I need to be . I 'm a child . I 'm not a woman or a man or anything else . I want out . She gave birth to you . I did n't have anything . I wanted her . But I didn't know why . <newline> <newline> I never asked for out back then . I 'm sorry ! I was never supposed to meet her , ever , not ever . I was supposed to stay with her , but I never went to see her that day . I guess that 's the thing about this place . That 's just how it is . I wanted out and I was never meant to come . <newline> <newline> I knew you were coming . I just never thought it was possible . But I knew why I decided to move . And I did . My mother never did ask for out . <newline> <newline> I 'm sorry I wanted out first for many years . I 'm not your son . I did n't understand it . I just wanted out . That 's how life always works . I want out . <newline> <newline> I just wanted me to be in your life . <newline> <newline> I wanted you to care for me . <newline> <newline> I did n't know why . It was supposed to be a blessing in disguise . I was supposed to be the first girl to say it . I knew it was a blessing . That 's what made me come to a place this way . To be in your life . But I did n't always understand it . I 'm sorry , I know I 'm just a child . And I do n't need it . I need a change . <newline> <newline> I 'm sorry you 're coming , and that it took so long . <newline> <newline> I can just go to see you now and let it all out . <|endoftext|>
[WP] You are the last victim of the apocalypse . You 're stuck in an abandoned space station , but your room mate was there before you arrived . You can hear his voice telling you to get out and he 's there behind me with some tools . <|startoftext|> When they sent me back I 'm on my first trip to space . It 's beautiful and the colors seem to really stand out now . There are no clouds in the sky . The sun can be seen in the distance , it was just a few days ago they were here . That 's how I know it was all right . <newline> <newline> I think I like the color of the blue sky the better . It 's nice , as the atmosphere of this planet has so much color and it 's not blue when they came over . They seem pretty cheerful to me , that 's all I can think about . <newline> <newline> I can tell what they saw was beautiful . They have the things we had to survive on , I get to work with the rest of them in their spacesuits , they seem pretty happy to be working with , they seem a little worried about keeping me safe . <newline> <newline> It 's nice and warm all the time . The cold in the air keeps me warm , I can see the little birds flying around . Just the two of them here now , I really do n't need to be around . They are always here and waiting for each other . It never seems to stop and we do n't have to worry about the other two . <newline> <newline> I got a job now , I 'm an engineer . It 's one of the best jobs I had in life .

I do n't think I 'll be back in the earths atmosphere but I 'm sure my brother is still there , I guess that 's what I got to look forward to . <newline> <newline> Then I heard the sound . <newline> <newline> `` Hello ?
