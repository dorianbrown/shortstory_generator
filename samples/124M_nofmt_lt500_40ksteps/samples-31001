[WP] In the far future , people are born with a soul . The older you are, the older you live . When your soul expires the previous owner dies , and so does the young one . <|startoftext|> "Welcome to the year 2085. This is your first time as a'whole person '. Our newest'whole person ' is here with you! You can experience yourself with the living world, but you will also be born with different personalities! If you don't like your younger self, you can still be here with the'whole person '. <newline> <newline> Don't worry about us, we have everything you need to know about you, but our soul is very important! The'whole person' remembers you, they give you the memory of the past, the soul is your soul. You might find that you only remember the past one, and the soul is the reason you don't remember. If you love those two people, then you can keep on with all the memories you have, so that you can continue enjoying life with the two people you love so much. <newline> <newline> The Soul is your soul! So enjoy life with both of the people you love, because you will always enjoy your soul! That's exactly why the soul is special! It is our special part of the new'whole person ' personality, that if you don't like your younger self, then it's just your soul. No more getting drunk, drinking, being high, having a bad fall, getting hit by several cars, or dying yourself... don't worry! You will always be with the soul, whenever you die. The only thing that changed during the'whole person's transformation was that everyone remembers them. So your soul is never going away. <newline> <newline> Well, what does that have to do with anything, I'll tell you one thing though, after I die, I will always be'with someone I love ' with another soul, so on this day, after you die, you'll never have a younger soul! <|endoftext|>
[WP] Make me feel sorry for Dr. Suess <|startoftext|> I walked down the street, knowing exactly what I was going to see. I walked into the mall and saw a bunch of girls with the same name, walking towards me with a slight smile over their faces. That is what they were, a slight smile, a slight smile. As soon as I walked through them I knew what they were dealing with. As an overweight male, they were almost all women. <newline> <newline> I made my way through to a bank that belonged to a woman. The ladies and gentlemen's were nice to me when I entered this bank, but after seeing the little girl walk towards me, I gave an evil smile back. With a quick look, I made my way towards the women and gentlemen, only to see them look as calm as they did in their expressions. This was the first thing I found, as these women and gentlemen had walked through an alley, only to see a woman with a smile on her face in the middle of a building. <newline> <newline> That made my eyes water, I slowly walked further towards the women and gentlemen, trying to understand what was going on. As I neared the woman, I noticed she was in a panic. She looked around to find me, but as with most men, she was hiding behind a counter in the middle of the floor. I took a deep breath and slowly brought her down towards the counter. As I neared the lady, she started to scream and start running. When I looked up, she was no longer in the ground.

' the man asked as he left my account. He had my number. <newline> <newline> A few weeks later, it happened... the women and gentlemen were found not only inside a bank, but also in one of my homes, but in my living room, a bathroom, and my bed. It is when I knew I was out of a job that I knew I had to make a move. To the horror of the women and gentlemen, I started to run. <|endoftext|>
[WP] You buy a gun from a man who thinks he is a cop . The problem : He shoots himself in the foot . <|startoftext|> I walked into the store with my briefcase. I took a look around, "Hey bro, would you like some coffee?" <newline> <newline> The man sat down by the counter and
