 the first , my soul once again , I began to cry , for my wife would n't hear me yet . <newline> <newline> The first time was my third ; the third time I heard my beloved wife 's pleas for the first time ; for my only joy was now mine , my happiness would never reach her , my sadness remained unhearing . <newline> <newline> I saw tears filling my eyes , tears filled my mouth , and it would n't last <newline> <newline> The first time , I saw my wife cry for me ; for as the last of her breath escaped her lungs , she began to cry for her . <newline> <newline> I saw another , and could n't see his face , but I could hear his voice . <newline> <newline> I would not survive his abuse , and as tears filled my eyes as he abused her , he abused me . <newline> <newline> My second time , I heard my own screams as I was stripped of my dignity and dignity as my manhood . <newline> <newline> I would break down in tears , as I had broken down in pain . <newline> <newline> Then his hands reached out , and I saw his face , his own face as the tears filled his eyes as I was being cast down . <newline> <newline> His eyes opened wider as he screamed , as he finally got the hint , as his anger would finally pass . <newline> <newline> As he turned to see me , I saw him , the man who would n't ever know happiness again . <newline> <newline> That 's the truth . <|endoftext|>
[WP] In 200 words , tell the story of someone who discovers how the world really works . <|startoftext|> I wake up in the morning as always , with the same sleepy look on my face . <newline> <newline> I turn over to find an apple sitting on a tree branch . It 's got a small chunk at the back , but I 've never eaten it . It seems to belong to me . <newline> <newline> My first thought after I have napped is about how a tree was only a few feet away from me . With a huff to my dismay , I fall onto my back and sleep in . <newline> <newline> I am tired , confused , and very alone . <|endoftext|>
[WP] Your SO is the zombie apocalypse , and she 's been with you the longest . You 've been fighting them off for years but they 've just grown crazier , more capable . <|startoftext|> `` ... I 've missed you , I can see it , you 've been missing all these years . '' <newline> <newline> That moment felt like it had been a lifetime . It was a beautiful scene in the sky , I 've seen so much of this on tv , but now I was n't sure where I was seeing the stars so many times in my life . <newline> <newline> `` The ones that are n't dead , my darling . They are waiting here to take you , it gives me the will to live , it 's just like them . '' <newline> <newline> I 'd been running around with my arms and legs , making sure to look them up in case they were nearby . The zombies were not looking too bright , I 'd seen a lot of them back while I was wandering around . It was scary looking at so many of them , but at the same time I just wanted to forget . <newline> <newline> `` They 've been following us for years now . I 've been waiting around for them all these years . I knew that they would take us out , I just had to be the hero . '' <newline> <newline> It must have been a long time . I never even thought I could take them out . I was just so exhausted . It 's weird being dead , you 're used to something like this . <newline> <newline> `` It 's all your fault , is n't it , you had to see them coming you know . They knew they could n't win , it 's been you since the beginning . '' <newline> <newline> I did n't have to take this . They would finally win , I was the man that would save the human race . <newline> <newline> `` I have seen you every time you left , '' she spoke with a sigh . `` But you have n't seen me as much as you should have as now . All that time I thought I was going to die , not living , dying for the first time . <
