======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 you . <|startoftext|> I had been thinking of getting married the whole time , but my boss was kind of a dick . That 's saying something because it was kind of a dick to his face . <newline> <newline> I do n't know what 's so great about it though . I 've always had a soft spot for girls , and I 'm kind of a small nerd . I just had a soft spot for being a good friend and helping out around the house , with me . <newline> <newline> I love my wife . She 's my wife , after all . I do n't want her as much as I have , but I do n't want too hard of a marriage to go get married either . That 's where the trouble comes in . <newline> <newline> I 'm scared though . <newline> <newline> I 've always had a soft spot for girls , but I 've been scared off just looking at a couple . I could just sit down with them and talk to the one thing that would let me be happy for a while ... but now I want to be miserable , with no more men , no more women . <newline> <newline> I 'm gon na go out and have it out with my boss because I did n't want her , but now that I 've been able to see it so much more clearly I 'm sure that it 's a real treat . I think I would go out , have a beer with the couple and then ask them out again . Maybe I would ask them out with a nice little kiss , and maybe if I said yes I would ask them to dance , and if I did I 'd let dance go around . I 've lost all of my old tricks though , at least here 's something I can do with all my energy . I 'm going to give up a happy life and live for a few more years . <newline> <newline> I 've never worked myself this hard before , but I will tomorrow . Tomorrow I get this job and I 'll be a great guy , but I do n't want it anymore . I 'm not going to give up a happy life and live for a few more years . And I 'm glad I could say yes to my wife because I 've never worked myself this hard then . <newline> <newline> <|endoftext|>
[WP] A man , in a lab coat , starts his experiments to test a new drug for a deadly nerve agent . He goes ahead and injects everyone who is present in the experiment with the new drug and does n't say a word . <|startoftext|> 'It is safe , it does n't harm me . You ca n't know how it works , it ca n't harm you . It will kill me . '' <newline> <newline> He tried to hide . <newline> <newline> `` What do you mean you will kill me ? '' <newline> <newline> His head was tilted to the side , eyes fixed on the machine . He tried to think of the experiments he 'd made . He did n't quite have the balls to run the tests , but he could go get a grip on it . It would look good on him . At least it would make him feel better . A doctor 's tool . But what was the point ? His labcoat had the same appearance . Well , it was n't even the white coat , his labcoat was just so damn good . <newline> <newline> He could do as he pleased . But he was n't very good at what he did and had never taken the time to really think about what he wanted . The thing was that the only time he 'd ever thought his labcoat was perfect were the first few times . He liked them and he wanted them , so this time he was going to go . He 'd put the whole experiment on a roll and he liked to think he was on the right track . His hands would get dirty if this damn machine was n't functioning ; it did not mean the whole thing was working right . He could do as he pleased . <newline> <newline> `` You 've done the right thing . '' <newline> <newline> `` ... well ... I guess so . '' <newline> <newline> `` So you 're done then . '' <newline> <newline> `` ... '' <newline> <newline> `` I knew that ! '' <newline> <newline> He could not stop breathing . The machine stopped breathing and it made him feel sick to his stomach . He was no longer a scientific gentleman . He wanted to scream . The doctor turned to his left and shouted . <newline> <newline> 'I am
