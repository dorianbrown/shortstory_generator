 hate and hate you for all the wrong reasons . <|startoftext|> The wind has a good heart , and it is coldly windy it seems . The clouds seem to be the only thing preventing the rain from falling . I take in the deep breath I guess we can trust you to tell us everything to the best of your ability : the best in everything and only a man . I 'll let you use the power of your arms for the day , I promise . This is n't the first time our relationship has been this bad though , I can tell from the time I 've known you I have felt so different here than at home . I think it was because I had always been a man . If you had a weakness I would n't know . Just as a man it is in your weakness . I would n't know you because I hold a knife to your throat , I do n't know how it feels to live your life knowing someone would be hurt , I do n't know how this pain works out , it was n't too much longer , but I guess that has to be it . <newline> <newline> Now we get home , I can see why you 're here , it 's cold and the snowing is not so much like the last time . I should have said to leave but now I 'm stuck with you , it has to be because I have to use my arm for the day to come . <|endoftext|>
[WP] At noon , one of your favourite writers , after hours of waiting for her , finally comes home to his/her <|startoftext|> It 's a rainy morning on a hot summer night . I wake up feeling tired and sore from my head and my stomach drops to the ground . The doctor is coming with a little medicine that makes me look in the mirror . `` What 's your doctor saying ? '' he says . `` You are starting to gain weight , my patient '' . `` I am going to give you an injection of some sort '' <newline> <newline> I 'm not feeling better right now . My heart is racing now almost as fast as it used to be . But before I know it , my chest is pumping hard yet the doctors are asking me if I can put enough oxygen into my chest . I 'm not sure how to say anything , but `` this is a lucky surgery '' <newline> <newline> `` I guess it was a lucky surgery. '' <newline> <newline> I nod . `` Yeah , thank you doctor . Have a nice day '' <newline> <newline> She looks down at her papers . The letters are dry and heavy at the corner of her eye ... and I can feel her breath run over her body . I do n't know to what extent I really want her to have any kind of heart but I know that I can no longer stop the flow of her blood . I feel as if a weight on my neck has lifted from beneath me . <newline> <newline> `` Oh , God , sorry , I was wrong ... '' <newline> <newline> It 's a rainy morning on a hot summer night . I wake up feeling tired and sore from my head and my stomach drops to the ground . The doctor is coming with a little medicine that makes me look in the mirror . `` What 's your doctor saying ? '' <newline> <newline> `` I 'm going to give you an injection of some sort '' <newline> <newline> I smile nervously at the doctor before he leaves . `` I guess it came for the best '' <newline> <newline> `` Well '' I smile as I pull out the paper I was writing now trying to convince myself I 'm not going to cry tonight if I know it 's for real . I wrap it to my left side with the sheets I 'm writing now writing some poetry to keep my brain in balance . I open the paper to reveal that the doctors are saying they have a news article about my son 's death . I see a note in the mirror , a name I ca n't pronounce properly but I know to never hurt him again '' <newline> <newline> `` It 's a rainy morning on a hot summer night . I wake up wet after hours of waiting to see his wife again , the doctors are saying he died in bed drunk . '' <|endoftext|>
[WP] I found the penultimate chapter of the prologue of a book . <|startoftext|> `` Why are you doing this ? ... I ca n't see it ! '' <newline> <newline> `` It 's not working . '' <newline> <newline> `` Oh ... ! What the fuck is that ? It 's ... it 's doing what ? ... oh no , it ca n't be .
