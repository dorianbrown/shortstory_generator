 cross . I had left my wife and kids at home . I had no choice but to follow them on their journey to nowhere ; to find my way with the money . I left this town about 8 miles away in an attempt to finish my sentence . But the roads were n't where I needed them to be . I stopped at the corner of Main Street and the River . A truck had been passing me by . I drove on . <newline> <newline> <newline> > > `` Do you have the money ? '' <newline> <newline> > No . I did n't . I did n't even have the cash to spend it yet . I did n't want to . But you knew . That I would . Even if I had it all . <newline> <newline> <newline> > > > > I did n't need to . I could do this . <newline> <newline> > > If you go into the back of the truck , you 'll see my house , it says I 'm going to work . It 's not . Do n't move it because you do n't want the money . Do it because you 'll never find any . <newline> <newline> > > > If you go back to where I was going . It 's not anywhere but to the left of the road ... you might believe . I left it . Now I 'm back . <newline> > > > So I 'd rather go back to go home . Than just leave that girl stuck in the car with a broken ankle . Do n't let her go . Do n't allow her to be stuck in the car with a broken toe . Do n't let her get her feet on the road ... and run . <|endoftext|>
[WP] A man has an accident and has been given control of the Earth . You are a soldier of the Earth . You are a scientist ; you are tasked to fight against evil with weapons of mass destruction . <|startoftext|> I woke up in my bunker behind a machine that spewed methane into the air . I looked in my direction and slowly walked over to the small green building in my area , a few steps from the main entrance to the bunker . I was about to step over it when a man stopped me with the metallic clanking of a rifle . I was not prepared to risk this life . And no one ever knows for sure how much I had saved , save for a few hundred dollars on my savings account . <newline> <newline> I looked around the bunker , then I walked over to the man beside me . He nodded and turned around to face me . `` So you are a scientist '' I asked and then raised my gun . The man turned around to look at me and a large amount of gore began to form on his face . `` What you are , sir '' he said calmly , and then a man began to sob and was cut off by a loud bang . I quickly closed the door and walked outside my bunker , where I had been hiding for a moment . Slowly I approached the building next to me and a few seconds later the soldier standing next to me was n't there . <newline> <|endoftext|>
[WP] There are five types of bullets at all times , no one uses them at all . Every shot is fired from a single angle . Make my day . <|startoftext|> I 've been trying to write everything I know . <newline> <newline> I 've got to write this . <newline> <newline> It has to be done . <newline> <newline> I will be working hard on it right now . <newline> But today is a bad day for myself . <newline> There were plenty of bullets there but not enough to actually kill her , you know . <newline> So I decided to do whatever it takes to get my girlfriend to be murdered , a pretty well known figure known in society as the God in the sky . <newline> The good news is , today was a really bad day . <newline> I am happy for her not to go to school and be homeless until she can come home and meet him . <newline> I 'm happy for the people to get to have sex . <newline> I 'll be writing all those things . `` Please be happy . '' You know what they will . <newline> I am happy to be able to work again , if only for a few more years before I leave this world . <newline> My friends will call me to tell me that she 's gone . <|endoftext|>
