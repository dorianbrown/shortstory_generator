[WP] In order to maintain society , a person is strapped to a chair . They are instructed that they will sit for a set time once they begin breathing . Once they are inside the chair and do n't look , a figure appears and demands to be seated . <|startoftext|> I wasn't particularly proud of the little fucker, but he wasn't the first time I had seen this guy, ever since I first met him. What I would have named him is The Demon. It was just a guy, that way, but he looked weird, and I really didn't understand why. Not until he got what was going to happen to me. My parents got into arguments over who would take a shit on him, and now, apparently, that's all they could care, because you don't have to be the asshole that you think you are, and that's where the Demon came in. I'm really embarrassed here, and if I ever find out, because we're both in a shitty fucking hotel, I hope I never have to meet another guy like him again. Because if he ever is, I don't think he's gon na come down here. <|endoftext|>
