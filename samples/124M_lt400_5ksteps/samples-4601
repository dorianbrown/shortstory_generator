 be what all humans are made to do . I can tell you they 're all just a part of it , and it makes their lives feel like a fucking job . All of them . <newline> <newline> They 're all in charge , and I am their boss . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <|endoftext|>
[WP] A young vampire has been captured in an execution . He is later shown to not be human , and is instead enslaved to a man named Tom who offers you freedom and to become his slave . You are his slave . <|startoftext|> So far we have been here ... I know we have been there . The darkness of the prison made me afraid of what I feel . I fear the dark , and I would die for what I truly believe is n't real . So I go through hell , I see other vampires , they tell me their names , what a monster they are . So I ask Tom to have a drink , and Tom says no , He says he wants to see *a soul , * 'cause he 's been here for longer than I have , He does not like having to drink , so he would be more fit for a good reason to become a vampire . <newline> <newline> So I ask Tom , I pray to him , 'cause I ca n't live without him , and I say I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry I ca n't see a soul with my own eyes , But I 'm sorry Tom , because I do n't see anything of anything you see . I asked him what are you afraid of , a soul , and he would say no , I do n't know anything of anything I see , I pray , you do n't want to see a soul . I ask Tom to make you a drink , and to make you see something I do n't know . So I ask him how he feels though , what a devil do I want to become , but he does n't know how I feel , and I ask him if that is possible , He does n't want to see my soul . <newline> <newline> So I ask him the question . <newline> <newline> `` Whose soul is it , Tom ? '' <newline> <newline> `` The human race , or maybe the one I have made '' <newline> <newline> `` The humans are all you know ? '' <newline> <newline> `` The human race is the one I could have made . So I ask Tom '' <newline> <newline> And Tom answered '' The humans are all what I know '' <newline> <newline> ( I 've included a link to a subreddit based on this question because I 'm not sure that can work on this format . If anyone wants it fixed , go ahead and check it out ; I 'll be on it later ) <|endoftext|>
[WP] A man has an extremely high suicide rate , and has been doing it for years . He 's had two kids , a cat , and an extra cat . One day ... <|startoftext|> It was the first time in the past five years that I had noticed somebody being suicidal . That 's why I have so many questions to ask myself . The question that has plagued my mind all of my life is , `` Are there other ways to help ? '' How many suicidal people were there , and how did I respond ? In that moment I decided I would ask my parents . All of a sudden I heard a voice from my parents speaking , `` It looks like the suicide hotline is open but we ca n't tell people they are suicidal because we ca n't tell people it was the suicide hotline . How can I figure out what is wrong with suicide hotline so I decided to just tell him that it is the suicide hotline . '' So now all I heard was my parents saying `` We have to make someone tell the suicide hotline what the suicidal is so that we can tell them , that it is the suicide hotline . '' <|endoftext|>
[WP] There were no tears in her eyes . She sat there , tears welling up , and the sun did n't hit her . <|startoftext|> When she was a little girl , she could read and dance and sing , and if she was lucky she could spend hours or days in blissful ignorance . But when her father died in a war , after he left , because it was to spare him , she was too afraid . When she was eleven , her father became sick and needed immediate surgery . Only when , so was he , did she feel her father 's death . That is , until she learned , that she could not understand what happened in that war . When I first started reading the stories of the war in the newspaper , there was so much
