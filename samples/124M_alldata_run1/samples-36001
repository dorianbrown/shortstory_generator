 that was the truth , you were right , and you had killed a whole bunch of people in cold blood . <newline> <newline> You wanted to make that clear in your story , or at least the reason I did n't do it . If I was the leader of the pack , I 'd want to tell you about my life . You would n't understand my intentions , not in the least . <newline> <newline> That 's what a hero likes to do . A good one . <newline> <newline> At least for now . I 'm in this journal because I want to tell you about the times I 've had with you . The times you 've made me feel safe . The times I 've made someone so very sorry for my actions . And there 's so many more , you know . So many . Yours is the one . <newline> <newline> You would have had me , if I were here to tell you . I caress the page in my hands . <newline> <newline> `` It happened . '' <newline> <newline> You were wrong , I still remember it . <newline> <newline> I did it . <newline> <newline> -- -- -- <newline> <newline> If you liked this story , you can check out my sub , [ The Secret Life Of Man ] ( https : //www.reddit.com/r/TheKiller_Afterlife/ ) <newline> My subreddit is [ PoeticWriterWriting ] ( https : //www.reddit.com/r/Portal/ ) <newline> <newline> I write from the perspective of the world as a new hero . <|endoftext|>
[WP] Write a superhero story in which the characters are constantly aware of their own weakness and struggle to overcome them . <|startoftext|> As one would expect from the most cliche-filled movie tropes , Bruce Wayne was the opposite of Superman . He was n't evil or evil like the Joker , or even Bruce Lee , he was just human ... <newline> <newline> But , to be honest , he was n't really like Superman . A superhero does n't always have his image , it just does n't always lead him to the correct conclusion of his villain career . Bruce 's nemesis , Superman 's father , never truly had an answer to his own problems . And yet , in this story , his son was the opposite of Superman to Superman Superman 's father , the perfect father . <newline> <newline> But ... Bruce grew up , and then became the man . To tell the truth , he became the man the Batman killed last night . It was n't just Bruce 's father who got the killing blow . Joker , and his henchmen , also all got their own little hand in the game . The Batman was the bad guy ... Bruce Wayne did n't take that as a word that could mean something , but he was the Batman . <newline> <newline> Gotham City was filled from the moment Bruce Wayne turned 19 . Not just the residents , but the whole city . People were watching him with rapt attention . He never spoke , he never smiled ... he only spoke to those he knew , and those that loved him . He was never afraid of the Joker , nor did he give up hope for the city . <newline> <newline> Bruce Wayne was the hero , and the villain . Bruce Wayne never wanted to be a hero . And the Joker was the villain . Bruce Wayne never asked for advice from him . Never asked for a moment 's pause from the great villain to stop the killer that killed Batman . Bruce Wayne was never good enough for Bruce Wayne . And thus , the world was not ready for his son to save it . He wanted it to be clear to everyone that it was the Batman that killed him . It was n't just Bruce Wayne , but the whole city . <newline> <newline> Bruce Wayne 's father was always a man of his convictions . The Batman went to the temple all the time , to speak unto him . Bruce Wayne lived a life of righteous faith , and it showed him his dedication . He knew every decision , every crime , every loophole he could pull off and , to Bruce Wayne , it always meant he 'd be ready for the end . <newline> <newline> Batman could never be good enough for Bruce Wayne anymore . Bruce Wayne grew up , and it 's as clear as day to him now . The Batman was n't just man , but he 's *hero* . And so , for the first week of the year of Batman versus Bruce Wayne , Bruce Wayne turned himself as Batman and Bruce Wayne became man . They fought like brothers , and in the end , Bruce Wayne got a freebie . Bruce Wayne was Batman .
