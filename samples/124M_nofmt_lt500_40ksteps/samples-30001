[WP] Write a story that ends so anticlimatically that I immediately stop listening to it . <|startoftext|> A loud screeching noise woke the small room of the small boy that had awoken that morning. It was not human, or at least the boy did not believe that. It was a scream. Then something woke him from his sleep which wasn ’ t unusual since he ’ d awoken to it, or even more unusual when he woke up. Some sort of cry. Either is a cry. The voice came from somewhere and was familiar, much like the other sounds he was hearing. It was coming from his eyes. They were blue and white, eyes as red as snow. Its hands were red. <newline> <newline> And his voice… It was all very soothing. The familiar sound was getting closer and closer, his throat was closing together a small clanging sound was now coming from underneath his nose. There it was in the man's hand, gripping his hand. He looked up to the two familiar faces, and saw the fear in these two men's eyes. All they did was nod their head in agreement, some sort of approval. But there was something unnatural in these two men's eyes, something that was different to their own. There the same fear began to take over, it was like a wave or a crashing or a sound, and then a voice coming at him. It was just his voice. <newline> <newline> "Yes… I have come for you." The voice was quiet, yet with his eyes staring at him through his red eyes. But he did not turn away, for it was the only way he knew the sound of. <newline> <newline> "I think you may want to come with us, as we must find a safe place here." <newline> <|endoftext|>

Thanks <newline> <newline> -- <newline> <newline> <newline> I woke up and walked to the bathroom but quickly brushed my teeth and sat up as if nothing was happening.
