 '' <newline> <newline> `` Why ? '' <newline> <newline> She looked me up and down , seeing the anger in my eyes . I took her hand , the same as she did yesterday . I did n't wait . <newline> <newline> `` Because I can not stop this world from becoming a place of horror . '' She said , her words thick and viscous . <newline> <newline> `` No , '' I said , `` I will not be forced into the past . '' <newline> <newline> `` I will be left behind , forever , without the knowledge of what it might have been like . '' <newline> <newline> I could not help but let go , for I am what I will always be . I will make this world a place of wonder , with each day an adventure , and each victory an opportunity , and all will become what it shall . <|endoftext|>
[ IP ] The Hero vs. the Villain <|startoftext|> `` I 'm tired of these battles . Everyone keeps coming to me , begging to be my friend , '' he sighed . <newline> <newline> `` You 're not helping the town , either . You 're probably a worse monster than your sister . So why do n't you go fuck yourself '' she said . `` I do n't care if you 're just a kid , you 're way too much '' I shot back . <newline> <newline> `` How about this ? We 're friends now . We can do whatever we want , '' he said , trying to find a strategy to be our defense if we win . <newline> <newline> `` Not really , your not really your sister either , '' I said sternly . `` How about this . '' He sighed again and started to get agitated . <newline> <newline> `` You do n't think this through , do you ? Do n't just give those monsters what they want . You want to just make enemies , you want to go out and do the worst possible thing , and just let it slip that it 's all your fault '' she said , a little bit more seriously than I wanted . `` There are better ways to deal with the villain . You 've seen that before , you know . '' <newline> <newline> `` But if we could just figure out what kind of villains we want , no one will be worse off , or that one will n't even know about it , '' I said . `` It 's not like you ca n't just turn it off and stop the bad guys from doing what they want , and then the hero goes and helps them . Who really does n't want to be the villain ? They ca n't even do anything right '' I said . <newline> <newline> `` That 's the problem you ca n't really be the bad guy because the villain can be turned back into the hero . He 's the hero because you wanted to do the wrong thing . So you always have to be good , 'cause it just does n't do . '' I said a bit louder this time , trying to force down my voice and not letting it ring too high , and to make that sound more menacing . <newline> <newline> `` It will help us , but that 's not what you are . You mean we 're good ? You think when we go to war we would n't care ? It does n't matter how you stop them . I ca n't help but feel you 're just looking for the good to make the town more or less good , that 's all just part of being good at some kind of thing you are , but for the worse the whole town is a waste . '' I said . <newline> <newline> `` You can be good at your job and all , but that never really makes anyone any good , especially you , '' she said , getting upset , but still trying to think of a way to have this conversation as calm as possible . <newline> <newline> `` That 's not the problem I 'm facing . The big problem is you are so far out that I ca n't stop what you 're doing before I do it . And now you know my name , your first name , it 's not much longer now . '' I had to pause here to let that last sentence sink in . <newline> <newline> `` Oh no it is . Why wo n't you just try to get help ? The good way 's better , but the bad guys ca n't do it just take it from you to save them . I 'm the worst villain ever created , but the worst villain ever created is myself . Do n't you think you 're the worst villain ever ? '' <newline> <newline
