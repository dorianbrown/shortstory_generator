The elevator had been closed since the beginning of time , as she 'd been riding her life on it . But it 'd been just another ride of the elevator until the people on the ground were safe . <newline> She was not going to be safe this time , not with her body , not with the world . <|endoftext|>

There was no hope for all his lives ... at least for a little while longer ... until finally , the death came . He would not have the chance .
