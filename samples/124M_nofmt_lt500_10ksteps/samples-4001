 this time, and that was the story of the three children. <newline> <newline> But there was a hitch. The third child hadn't even realized what it was exactly, he didn't understand. The first child could hear the sound of two of the boys walking to the toilet, with the next child just a little closer. They looked at each other, both of them were scared, and not that scared at all. But there was something else coming. For a second, the third child looked at the other kid and was stunned. As if he were looking at himself right now. That wasn't quite the end of it ; he felt a sensation of heat, just like the others in the room. But there was more. The third child began to feel a warmth. It began to pull the other boy's clothing off by his ankles. That was when the first boy grabbed him and pulled him. The other boy was still alive and looked at the third child, with shock on his face. The boys are close now. <newline> <newline> For a second, there was a flash and the three boys and the woman were all running in a circle. But the rest of the circle was all outrun by the adults. I remember the first one. My mom, she was yelling at me too, calling to tell me everything is alright. The other two adults were looking around, wondering why were the boys and then the woman... I guess I was hoping to be some kid. <newline> <newline> <|endoftext|>
[WP] The person in this universe is actually a human <|startoftext|> The sound of a clock made a gentle rustle in the air beneath him. He sat on his bed and stared at the time. Today was a day to celebrate. Today had been an easy task for him. He just needed to get back to his office, back home and get his wife. At least the first two days weren't bad at all. He was sure as hell still alive. That said, he decided to change one detail. One more detail that made the first person look up at him in the eyes, his face was pale white. One by one they came up to me and asked for some fresh air and I replied that I was going to go back to my little office in the city. To make sure she would be happy, he asked for some air and said he would return on his own. That was why the day started on a cliff that I knew the person was about to start. It wasn't a cliff but it definitely was a cliff. He asked for some fresh air and returned to his office. It was a busy day and I needed to prepare myself. I sat down near the fireplace and sat next to him in the fire. He looked at me with a look that almost seemed to be a pity. I put down my fire and went out to a fire pit. He looked at me with eyes that looked so tired and his eyes were still pale. The fire pit didn't move, only smoke rose from around my face and smoke rose to engulf it and put it out of my sight. As I pulled his arm away I just couldn't let him go to another fire and he kept looking at me. The look that he had on his face made him forget how much time had passed for me. In that instant he knew about my life and he had come to take it. Not just in the eyes but around him as well. <|endoftext|>
[WP] You wake up on a beach and find a note inside the ocean <|startoftext|> "You can smell it," I said, trying not to laugh. <newline> <newline> The note had said this was an island on a desert island, it was called Koopa Bay, it was named after the Koopa. <newline> <newline> In the early morning hours, I woke up to the sounds of a strange, large, sandy forest below. The notes said it looked like some sort of large ocean, a lake, or something else. My feet felt heavy as I climbed through the woods, climbing through and through every single branch that ever connected with the ocean bed. But that was not the case when I started walking up the ocean floor, I began to move in a different direction, and I soon ended up here. <|endoftext|>
[WP] An immortal , trying to save the human race from an extinction event has been captured on video . This makes it very unpleasant to think about . <|startoftext|> The first video we ever made was captured in New Mexico. It showed a group of four men and a woman in the process of slaughtering thousands of innocent people. The people who live here on this planet are suffering horribly. <newline> <newline> In the video, several characters are talking in a panicked voice. One is a
