It read : <newline> <newline> D-o-u-d-o-l-a-a-a-n-u <newline> I have just received a letter in the post - Please do n't go near the light . <newline> <newline> Dear Sir , we have just received a copy of the letter you burned down . Please do n't go near the light - even in a letter of this nature . <newline> <newline> It was addressed to all who dared to look , who dared to stand , and even who dared to run . It told you the consequences of your actions . It told you the consequences of what did n't , so you must live with each and every decision you made , every decision that did n't take you closer to the light , and even those that did , until you came to stand . <newline> <newline> And it warned you of their consequences , which would be grave . They were the consequences of your actions . Each and every decision that did n't end in the light . <newline> <newline> Now , when you stand and stare at the light , the consequences are everywhere . Each and every mistake you make ; every little one you made , and every hurt that hurts you at the end of the day - every mistake , and every step you took to light . The consequences of your actions . <newline> <newline> The consequences of making the light , as the light will do . <newline> <newline> Do n't go near it . <|endoftext|>
[WP] Write the letter that you always wanted to , but never did . <|startoftext|> To all , <newline> <newline> <newline> Thank you for a hard and painful work . It 's been a joy to me - and really , all of my life . You 're such a good person , and so are I . <newline> <newline> Now , please , please , don â€™ t tell me to stop . I 'll tell you what to get me out of this . <newline> <newline> If I were to ask you if you have ever made a mistake , would you tell me you have done nothing wrong . That you were n't always right , but only when you were scared ? That you 're only good in small amounts and when you need it the most ? Of course you would . <newline> <newline> Do you even read the damn paper anymore ? I 'm asking you not to break the rules - stop asking me that ! <newline> <newline> It 's not your fault , man . It 's me 's fault . <newline> <newline> Thank you , and thank you for a really great piece of writing ! <|endoftext|>
[WP] There are 100s of dead bodies in a graveyard , why are the people in the graveyard still alive ? <|startoftext|> It was a dead man 's tomb .

The father of her son looked upon her and with his heavy heart he prayed for justice . <newline> <newline> No one had ever come back from a dead man 's tomb ; they just came back after they died . <newline> <newline> When a young boy was found alive and his corpse had already been removed they would come back to the graveyard crying . The boy 's father would be heartbroken and he would never find his son again . The dead person would never mourn for him . <newline> <newline> The people of the graveyard had survived because they did n't bury any corpses . Dead people were dead , just like all the others . <newline> <newline> The only difference between the dead and healthy was that healthy people always died when their bodies were being decomposited . <newline> <new
