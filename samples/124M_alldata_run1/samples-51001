 turned around and saw no one there ; they had been waiting for him to get inside . `` How are they doing ? '' I asked , still curious about where the hell this was going . `` They are going to hell '' I turned around again , still looking for some signs before looking back at them . I looked around the room again and saw the man who could n't speak . <newline> <newline> `` Why are we here ? '' I asked . <newline> <newline> `` He wanted to be here . After a hard year , he thought that if he did n't be here he would n't get into heaven . '' <newline> <newline> `` But it only took a few more decades for him to die '' I said , looking forward to this . <newline> <newline> `` So , what did you think after the man died about your thoughts about heaven ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Well , I think my thoughts were n't a bad one . Like , you were the only one that had thoughts that went in circles . After that , I noticed something . If nothing else , I thought they must have gotten into heaven too . But after the man died I realized I did n't need to think if I wanted my heaven to be different from what people were living . I was happy . I was doing all I wanted . It was n't my fault I was so depressed . I did n't enjoy myself more than all of them combined , but that 's the reason I did not enjoy myself the way the people I loved . I was doing it because I wanted them to go to heaven after all . '' <newline> <newline> `` Well , you were also the only one who was happy . Did you have your life goals before dying ? Who had the most happiness ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Well , yeah . I just wanted people to do more for me . I do n't know why but I thought my life 's goals needed to be more rewarding or more ... ... ... ... . '' I stammered out . <newline> <newline> `` Well , who am I to say I was n't happy ? It was almost as if you were the one whose life goals were supposed to be more to yourself than others . I do n't know what caused you to leave everything and move into heaven so fast - your thoughts were n't just going in circles . We 're both in heaven now . '' <|endoftext|>
[WP] After a car crash , you are transported to a bridge . As time passes , you are the one that changes the course of the world . A hooded figure tells you his name is the only one left alive who can make it stop ... for me . <|startoftext|> How I got here , I do n't even know . <newline> <newline> I do n't know why , really . I 've been here my entire life . I 've never spoken . In fact I 've never told anyone , and now I 'm here , in this bridge , on a bridge that was once an entire neighborhood divided into smaller cities . I do n't remember what happened , but there it is . <newline> <newline> *Weave* <newline> <newline> I 've been walking this bridge , through this very same bridge where I 'm headed now , for several thousand years . I have no intention of stopping . I do n't know what 's inside , but there is no stopping me . After walking hundreds of miles through this bridge , I 've met people who 've been here before . There never seem to be anyone who has the right words . They all look the same . I 'm not sure who is the one that the words were for . <newline> <newline> I suppose that whatever 's behind the bridge ca n't be in reality . At any rate it ca n't be . I do n't know . I look in the face of a person walking into my home ; I 've never seen anything before . <newline> <newline> `` Is he alright , buddy ? '' <newline> <newline> That 's probably one of the stranger in front of me . I ask in a panicked tone and they say something in a language I recognize . A man in a suit or something like that . Or maybe both ? Who gets paid $ 250,000 to sit on some bridge ? Some crazy guy ? Or both ? <newline> <newline> I feel a cold metal hand on the side of my face as I turn my head so I do n't look at them . In fact I do n't look much further . <newline> <newline> `` Well he 's definitely not . He was walking for awhile , when he heard the bell rung and then
