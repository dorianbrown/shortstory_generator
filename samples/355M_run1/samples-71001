 <newline> <newline> The suns shining , the birds singing , the sun setting , and the clouds on a cloudy afternoon . <newline> <newline> It was a beautiful day , and it was the day all my friends were born . <newline> <newline> `` We should be done now , before we leave . This is our world , we should be done , bye bye . '' I murmured to the ground as I prepared breakfast . <newline> <newline> <|endoftext|>
[WP] A man who can not fall asleep and can not fall asleep <|startoftext|> The night is cold and a bit too dark . The moon is high up now , and it 's a constant , pulsing yellow that grows darker in the sky . I hear it every day , but tonight I must go to sleep . <newline> <newline> It is still as a star . <newline> <newline> <newline> As I stand I watch the stars begin to close in . They close for every few minutes , and as they finally reach the earth it feels as though time has started to flow , like a river . I can not say if my lungs feel dry but the cold air feels crushing , yet I do not seem to mind a little . I am not bothered for I am no star and I 'll never be one . <newline> <newline> <newline> But I know that my life will be forgotten one day . I know that it will pass out like this in the earth because I could not sleep once I got up this morning . I have no way to know what this will be , but I do know that I will be gone . <newline> <newline> I have been sleeping for so long that it is not difficult for me to stay up this much . I do n't even care to know where tonight is going , because I do not want to leave . <newline> <newline> <newline> I have been sleeping for so long that I do n't even need to make it to bed , but my mind is not capable of producing enough sleep to keep my brain active . No one will be there for me anymore . When time has moved too slowly I do n't want to live this life anymore . <newline> <newline> <newline> I have been sleeping here for so long that I do not worry about being lonely , only that I have long fallen asleep . I do not fear because I do not fear . In a way , I do n't fear that I will become the only man with a heart who can not fall asleep nor sleep long enough to know that he is being watched . <newline> <newline> <newline> I have been sleeping here for so long that I do not notice that time does not matter , only that my mind is not tired . I do not worry that I will be forgotten one day , because that day will not matter because I have had no one to mourn . In my mind they are all gone , so I do not fear . <newline> <newline> <newline> I have been sleeping here for so long that I have become a ghost in my mind , one I do not want to live in anymore . I do not fear that if I do live forever , my soul will be cast out of this place so that I can never truly be remembered and I can never die . But I do not fear . <newline> <newline> <newline> I have been sleeping here for more than a few hours now , yet I do not fear . I do not wonder if I will fall asleep before I die . I do not want to die , I want to live . <newline> <newline> <newline> It is a bit dark , my last light leaving soon . As I rest against the side of the road next to me I hear my light fade . Why ca n't someone come ? I do n't want to die . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- <newline> <newline> My story , if you have no idea how awesome this is .
