oftext|> "It sounds funny. And when I do talk, you just... walk off the TV and the first thing I say is that... you're really trying to break the fourth wall. They look at me differently. I'm a normal guy, I can talk about myself. <newline> <newline> "Yes I am. And you better not listen to me." <newline> <newline> I am, yes, but that is not what I feel when I'm talking to you. I feel like you understand ; I don't even know how to respond. And for a human like myself, sometimes you are just a blank space. You have no need to be understood. You are just being interesting. I want you to understand how nice you are. <newline> And that is my true quality. <newline> <newline> This is only a second hand. <|endoftext|>
[WP] You 're the son of the villain ! All of our lives have been the result of this villain , but he is the villain the world has come to know as The Joker . <|startoftext|> "Son, I hate you." <newline> <newline> "Yes, no, Son." I say slowly. The darkness, all the darkness, is one ; I feel this in myself. <newline> <newline> The Joker shrugs. "You really are a psychopath. Don't you see? My entire life I'm a psychopath. I'm a villain." I laugh. <newline> <newline> "But your actions? That would be one way to stop me..." <newline> <newline> "I don't know what to expect." The Joker says. "I have no idea how to stop you, do you?" <newline> <newline> "I don't think I can do anything... But if you can help me you can." I laugh, laughing. <newline> <newline> "What about the fact that I'm a hero?" <newline> <newline> The Joker shrugs. "What does that mean?" He grabs me by the arm and begins to pull me off the roof of my school, throwing me into the street. <newline> <newline> "You know I'm Batman so, well I've been doing that for three weeks now." The Joker sighs. "You know I'm a psychopath." The Joker reaches for my head and looks at me. "You'll see," he says slowly, "you know I'm Batman because I am." <newline> <newline> "Not because I want to. Batman is *my* superhero. No. You know I'm a villain right?" <newline> <newline> "Yes." <newline> <newline> Batman turns around slowly. "But you're a child too." He turns back to me. "You know what's good for." <newline> <newline> "But how can I be a good superhero?" The Joker shrugs. "Now, I'm wondering." He turns back to my mom. "Do you have any special gifts?" I look down at my body. "We're not going to allow you to eat any of the candy we have." I laugh, laugh, laugh. <newline> <newline> "Well, you can't leave me, so..." <newline> <newline> My legs grow shorter. <newline> <newline> "What?" He says, laughing. "You know I'm a villain." <|endoftext|>

It started with : <newline> <newline> *I don't know how you know I know this, but it doesn't surprise me. I've been watching you in the shadows for the next twenty years of your life. Your death is almost an expected thing. I feel sure your death is. * <newline> <newline> *I won't be surprised of all of it, I've been a time traveler a lot more. My parents have died. I had my own accident and I don't know where I am. The doctors don't even tell me which way I am headed. I've been in this house almost every day. I've seen you in so many places
