startoftext|> I hate this place . <newline> <newline> There ’ s no electricity, no running lights , no restaurants . I ’ m starving and there ’ s plenty of other people on a street , it ’ s just me and a few of the homeless . No windows , no doors , no furniture . It ’ s depressing . <newline> <newline> It ’ s easy to get used to things like this , but no matter where I go , someone is going to be dying . <newline> <newline> I know because when I find people in a state of grave danger I call the police , they ’ ve never heard of such a thing . Not the first time I ’ ve called , there ’ s always a second of silence between them both and then I say “ No ” again . I ’ ve tried it a dozen times before , and it ’ s always the same thing , I always get the same response . The police usually respond within an hour , then they ’ re done and they leave . Sometimes people only get picked up after hours and sometimes I just call someone and the rest ’ s never heard either . I ’ ve got no family , no friends , no family of my own . Everything ’ s been empty so far . I ’ m going to end up here by morning . There ’ s enough food around here for someone to survive . <newline> <newline> I hate this world . This life and in the moments of desperation , I ’ m leaving it all behind . <newline> <newline> I never thought I could feel that way . I never thought the world would end this way . I never thought I ’ d feel so alone , so alone and alone and helpless . I never thought I would be alone with myself , let alone trapped with no food , no family , no friends , no hope to survive . I ’ m leaving . <newline> <newline> I hate this world . I ’ m leaving it , and I ’ m going home . <newline> <newline> I never thought I ’ d go here . When I ’ m leaving this shit hole and there ’ s nobody left with me , I go home . <|endoftext|>
[WP] It 's now or never ... <|startoftext|> We used to call everyone a kinklantian slave when talking about sex , they called us chubby bitches , big ass bitches , pussies , dweeces , etcetera . The word cunt was a bit offensive back then . A bit derogatory and a little weird . But it stuck and is not used to today . In my life it is used often . When I was young , at the time , it was considered taboo to be around other people , especially with such a huge tattoo which read `` bitch '' . Even back then it was considered taboo to say anything about other people . I would n't have minded knowing why anyone did that , but not like now . Even in my early days I would hear other people talk about having to act like sluts , or being made fun of , you name it . I went through my high school years having those words in my head , the ones I knew every day from the very first time I heard them . By the time I graduated high school and got an internship I only had to hear from a few people , all the same words . `` You could have been so kind , you would n't have been such a whore '' it said in my head . Of course I would have thought it was hilarious , and I never could have been nicer . It is n't like my parents would n't be pleased , or teachers would n't have been so nice to me . And now here we are , in a dark alley full of drugs , I can say that I 've been going to and from every meeting . You 'd imagine that the last words would have been used a lot more than the last times . Not today , I have been doing nothing at all but listening to the last words in the last hours of my day . They say , `` You could have been so kind , you would n't have been caught '' it was my favorite line . And now I live alone , in this dark alley , with not a single word in my head . I am not only going to avoid going out , I do n't need my fucking pussy . I think now of the last nights of my last days , each one a bit different , but that 's probably for the best , I thought as everyone else who lives alone does when they reach the point of going out alone . It 's time for me to go out alone . <newline> <newline> I can see the shadows of cars and people pass , the last moments of my last few hours can be seen
