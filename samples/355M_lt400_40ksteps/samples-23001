 definitely he could sense their presence , but the more he thought about who was behind the screen the more he understood it was that screen . He 'd known that it was only a dream , but if he saw his girlfriend , he would know she 'd just as soon as found him dead , because she 'd come back home to find him bleeding on the floor beside him . <newline> <newline> All of the pain went away when this screen passed his attention . <newline> <newline> He thought he would get up and walk down to the kitchen and grab his phone from the floor , but he never did . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <|endoftext|>
[WP] You wake up in a dark room . You 've never ever seen daylight , but it 's so bright , you can see people through thick curtains ... <|startoftext|> I sat up in the bed , and was shocked to find that I 'd never had a look around the corner of my bedroom . I was confused , but a little hopeful , because in my opinion , that corner was the best , best possible place to be in that corner for the most part . I had never had a walk past it , though . But I was still walking around it , which I guess was a nice surprise , considering I had n't seen anyone , and I probably do n't have any friends with that line of sight . Oh yes : I still know that there should 've been some sort of " outside world '' , but that 's another question for another day ( at least ) . <newline> <newline> I decided to wander over to my room , and opened the door to the right . My room itself was a beautiful , but peaceful one . I turned on the shower and looked at my face for a minute . I was so bored , that I probably would 've turned the volume up higher if I had noticed the way the water would 've looked , or the way that everything was falling in the corner . I was a little bummed out that I was a little bit outside . But I still wanted to find that corner . <newline> <newline> I walked the other way , and ended up at the window . The house just ... seemed to shrink , but I could n't notice it . But my house , that was definitely *more real* than it was . <newline> <newline> I looked through the window and saw nothing outside . So , I climbed the window again . And waited for the house to shrink back . <newline> <newline> Suddenly I heard a scream . Or rather , heard nothing . My bedroom appeared to have gotten a little warmer . <newline> <newline> And then , as if from nowhere , the house shifted a little . <newline> <newline> <newline> <|endoftext|>
[WP] A child 's birthday party is to the point where they are screaming at the television for cartoons , as if they were actually there . <|startoftext|> `` So , I really wanted to see you , '' I said , tapping my nose . <newline> <newline> `` Why ? '' she replied . <newline> <newline> `` Because there 's nothing to see . '' <newline> <newline> `` Oh for shits ... '' she said , `` Now , could you please leave right now ? '' <newline> <newline> I looked to my right , and saw her leaving me for yet another stranger . <newline> <newline> `` You ca n't just stare blankly at me all day '' <|endoftext|>
[WP] You have a power that can cause anyone to feel any emotion at the moment they are about to die . However , you do not want to cause someone else to experience this . <|startoftext|> I 'm sorry , I need to go . <newline> <newline> The last time I did so was at the funeral . Our wedding , the day when I asked Dad and Mom for our first kiss , the year we lived in the same apartment building that was burned down the night before we broke our hearts , and my mother 's heart . <newline> <newline> And before that ... she was so beautiful . Beautiful as always , the beautiful blue eyes gleaming , the perfect smile , the sweet voice . But then , for a moment , she died in the fire . <newline> <newline> I was n't there , and still am . <newline> <newline> And for a second , I was there . <newline> <newline> I wish that I could leave that room . <|endoftext|>
