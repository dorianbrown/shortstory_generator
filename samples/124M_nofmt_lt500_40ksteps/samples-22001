 wake what you thought you had lost." <newline> <newline> As she said these things, he suddenly became aware of something underneath him. A slight touch on his stomach. She smiled warmly and looked down at him, her warm smile wavering with his breath. "I guess, you're right, you'll always know the taste." <newline> <newline> <|endoftext|>
[WP] You are a scientist studying a dead body , in the middle of your research ... <|startoftext|> *Tick. Tick. Tock. * <newline> <newline> A faint buzzing noise emanates from every living thing in the room. Some of them are on their laptops. Some are sleeping. Some are breathing. Some are breathing for the first time in a long time. It is the same sound every living thing heard. And it is growing louder over the years, louder by the minute. I stare down in silence and it all becomes clear. <newline> <newline> The humming ceases. <newline> <newline> The buzzing reaches a fever pitch and there it is - the most unnerving, unnerving thing I've ever felt before or during the day. A massive ball of white, a shape that is as large as a basketball, is moving towards me. It starts with every other sound that has ever been and my brain races. I am frozen and the words "Fuck." fade out, and I can no longer vocalize. <newline> <newline> It doesn't take long. I am about to leave for my office when the white noise stops, just as everyone else appears. They're all on the floor. It is in my head, but I don't register what happened. My hand tips over the table. I can't bring myself to move. My head has to be cold ; I have to be breathing. <newline> <newline> There is a loud crack in the ceiling. A hand hits my head. I scream and I don't know why, but it is still too loud and my mouth can't stop crying. <newline> <newline> I feel like a giant in my head, a monster inside this house. A shadow of myself, covered in a blanket and a scarf, stares ahead towards me. Then I can finally make out the shape of the ball. A giant ball, with it's hand hovering above it. <newline> <newline>... <newline> <newline> A black, humanoid creature emerges from what I assume is a pool of blood and I am no longer breathing, but I can see it moving toward me. I can barely make out what it is doing and it is staring at me as if I do some sort of trick on me. I can feel the anger building within me and I can just stare at it but the beast is trying to get it's head into my hand. <newline> <newline> The claw on my arm is coming along. The creature is looking down at me for a moment, the eyes moving on towards me, then on towards my hand and finally, my face. I look down at my hand and see a tiny symbol on it. <newline> <newline> "Oh please, help me!" I scream. <|endoftext|>
[WP] You die and wake up in a very unfamiliar room . You notice that the whole world seemed to be in front of you . You turn around and there you are , standing on the other side of a balcony , alone . <|startoftext|> "Why..why.. why did I go to this exact same place every night, it really brings some really, very strange." <newline> <newline> <newline> The young man looks around in confusion <newline> <newline> <newline>"Why..why.." <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> "No matter. Just go to this exact place every night, just take me to this exact place every night, and make me stay there." <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> The man continues to stare. <newline> <newline> <newline> "Well..I guess you need to understand there. The world is quite different in the past, the reason for my loneliness is not obvious. There was one time I was about five feet tall in a small room that was the size of a large town, I don't think I was an adult. Anyway. The reason I was alone at that point was because I was just as hungry as I am tonight and I liked myself enough to stay there and stay for months without the other three people who I would ever meet anywhere else. So I wandered around for awhile, eventually coming upon a place that I would be able to call my own, but
