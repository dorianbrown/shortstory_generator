 flowers . <newline> <newline> The snow covered the road , and the wind picked up until it was like a gentle caress . <newline> <newline> There was a single figure , covered in a deep red trench coat , who waited beside the road . Her eyes , which were all sunken down into her dark , thin skull and the pupils of her hair were replaced by an empty , pale blue dot . She was covered in a small fur coat with a stringy strip of fur stuck to the collar . One of her paws had started to disappear underneath her , leaving only the tip of her tail behind . She reached out and scratched my head . She looked at me and she smiled very briefly before heading back to her sleep . <newline> <newline> I was stunned as she pulled out the bat and prepared to hit me . She laughed , before turning around , catching her breath . <newline> <newline> I was frozen with disbelief as it landed right in her side . <|endoftext|>
[WP] You 're a man who has been living like this for decades when your wife dies . You 're convinced that you will always look as if you 're about to die . Your son . <|startoftext|> `` I think I 've figured it out , '' I said , standing between the man and his daughter . It 's getting late now , and it 's getting cold now , but he 's still there . <newline> <newline> `` It ca n't be . I really have to get back now . It 's not like i 'll come back from it , '' he said , in a way that made sense . I loved him , but there was always a reason to leave the basement under the guise of death . I guess he knew me too well , then . <newline> <newline> `` My mommy died from cancer , and there was n't a whole lot left for me . '' I took pity on the man in the trench coat . He wanted to get back to his daughter , not his wife . <newline> <newline> `` Mommy will come back , I promise you . '' <newline> <newline> `` Then I 'll come back , I promise , '' he said again . <newline> <newline> `` You can say no to me if I wanna go home , '' he said . <newline> <newline> I could have given up . I could have left him , but it 's too late . It 's getting cold so I 'm feeling my wits end , so will he . If only I could say I loved you when you were sick again , and I did n't when you left . But I ca n't go home now without a beer , a cigarette , and a pack of cigarettes . <newline> <newline> `` I did n't mean it to be to you , son . You 're just a monster . '' <newline> <newline> `` I know . I know , '' I whispered . <newline> <newline> No . I wo n't . I 'm gonna go to my room . <|endoftext|>
[WP] You wake up one morning and find yourself in your basement in the middle of a massive fight ; it was your old high school fight . <|startoftext|> I woke up and there stood a boy in a trench coat and some military uniform with a big cross on it . <newline> `` What are you doing here ? '' I asked . `` This is me , '' he replied . `` I am an officer on this side of the country . I have served in this war all my life , '' I explained . `` But at this fight , we were all still friends of the enemy so we thought we would just hang out for a while . '' He walked by me and said , `` I guess that 's another reason why I 'm still alive . I was feeling tired so that 's why I thought it would be funny to fight you in this war again , so I thought we had already beaten each other , and we just were n't in shape . '' I explained what a terrible joke this had been , and I tried so hard to get him to leave me alone , that I really did feel like leaving the building . But I was standing there with eyes wide open , trying to find an exit , but my knees just could n't accept that any longer . I tried to make him stop by saying , `` That 's fine , you can just be an enemy and run . I do n't want to be a loser again . I want to face death . '' When I finally found a way to leave , I told him to just leave because then I had my own dream and I 'm never going to give up on that joke . <|endoftext
