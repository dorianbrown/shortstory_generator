[WP] You wake up , in a bed , with an unfamiliar voice . <|startoftext|> **Please , wake up early . ** <newline> <newline> My hand was shaking as I slowly opened the door to the other side . I knew that voice , it 's sound I can hear in the background . <newline> I glanced around the room and the words on the sheet of paper were all I could muster together before I reached the bed . <newline> <newline> `` Wake up early . '' it yelled , almost mockingly . <newline> I rolled out of bed and into the living room , I had a hard time seeing everything . The lights were too bright , they flickered every so quietly in the back of my mind . It was n't strange , this place , but it was creepy .

I did n't know what it was , though I had it from my mother . I felt so scared . <|endoftext|>

The voice started to grow a bit too loud , the tone quickly turning into a full blown alarm . <newline> `` It 's me ! We 're back together . `` , it started , a whisper from the speaker . I looked at it , a voice from my life . <newline> `` You are never really forgiven , always stuck with the guilt . So why not let the world rest on the shoulders of people who have forgotten what we had . `` , I said . <newline> `` ... And there they are ! '' I said , my voice trembling . The voice of my god . <newline> `` You made them ! And I 'll make them great people in the world . I promised you . But never ever again . `` , it sounded . <newline> The speaker slowly rose from my bed , leaving only a slightly louder buzz . I stood , holding the device close to his face . <newline> `` I swear it . You are not forgotten . I am not forgotten anymore . '' <newline> `` No , '' I said , shaking it .
