[WP] After you do a few more times after that the end , suddenly your whole life changes . <|startoftext|> `` Yes ? I do n't understand . '' <newline> <newline> `` Why do you want to know this ? '' <newline> <newline> I tried to explain what was happening to him <newline> <newline> And then the question that I knew I heard every day of the month : <newline> <newline> `` How did you get here I wondered ? When was it ? '' <newline> <newline> `` After you do n't know it . Your life and your existence is being changed by what happened when . So much so that you can not see yourself . Or anything , really . I can see you and all of your pain , so I may try to help you . '' <newline> <newline> The last sentence had me in a trance . `` I tried to help you . I 'll help you ? I need to make you forgive me . '' <newline> <newline> As I started to cry , I realized that I was dying inside of him <newline> <newline> <newline> `` God dammit ! I 'll save you from this pain and help you make peace with your own life . '' <newline> <newline> `` Please , Lord . Please . '' He looked up at me in pain then as I looked away and he gave up . `` I 'll be back to help you , but you already know I 'm gone . <newline> <newline> `` This is it . '' <|endoftext|>
[WP] If people can no longer look away from a cat , can anyone ? <|startoftext|> She was the one to make him come home for Christmas . She knew from day one he was her favorite ; she just had to let him come home , to have fun with him , and never miss him again . For the last 3 weeks his mom had been telling him that if he knew , he would have gone to college . To know what it felt like to live in a world where you could actually care about someone , one that would actually come to you . The idea was nice , but he knew he would have to spend his entire life in a school that taught him how to make love , how to make friends , when to kiss , and what not to say . I will make the best of it and he will live in his home . He 's grown up quite a bit since he was home , and now his mom is n't exactly his biggest role model . Now he has to be the sweetest , most caring mother . <newline> <|endoftext|>
[WP] The last line , `` I 'm sorry , '' said the man . <|startoftext|> `` Sorry , '' said the man . `` And that 'll help us all '' . <newline> <newline> `` But you 're a liar , '' the girl said . `` Are you a coward ? '' <newline> <newline> `` No , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , '' <newline> <newline> `` I do n't understand , '' the man said . `` I thought he was a good friend of mine . '' <newline> <newline> `` Oh , no , no , what 's wrong with that ? '' she protested . <newline> <newline> `` No , no , no , no , no , no , '' <newline> <newline> `` You were always doing things to the boy . '' <newline> <newline> `` No , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , '' <newline> <newline> `` He did nothing on my behalf , when he did . '' <newline> <newline> `` We are not supposed to talk about things like this . `` <newline> <newline> `` You did n't . '' <newline> <newline> `` No , no , no , no , no , no , no , '' <newline> <newline> `` Do n't let him know what you 've done this week .
