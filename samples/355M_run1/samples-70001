 the day was finally over , but I could n't be happier . <|endoftext|>
[WP] A person in the future arrives to the year 2100 . Write about why they should n't vote for them . <|startoftext|> There had been rumors that Donald Trump would win the election , but was there really any candidate who could have won against Hillary Clinton to the point of destroying the lives of millions ? <newline> <newline> People like Andrew Wakefield and Bill Murray all told me that the entire voting populace would rather be fed up with Trump than them , but the truth was , no matter what the media said , Clinton could have beat Trump . The media did n't know about the second factor , they had been covering this election in the way they usually did , but the American people voted for Trump anyway . It was true in the end , and the people voted for Trump to begin with . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <|endoftext|>
[WP] You wake up and see you have a completely new body . Your family is dead , and it turns out you 've been replaced with a clone of yourself . But the reason you 're wearing your new form is because your new body can read your mind . There 's no way out . <|startoftext|> `` Dude , '' I said as I stretched . `` Where is my head ? ! '' <newline> <newline> When I took my new form , everything had changed , everything . The old me stared at me in disbelief . My hair , still hair , had changed color . My eyes , white as they should have been , were now blue . My skin was white . But my new form could not move , not until the body I came from finished reading my thoughts . The new me had been wearing this same clothes from the day I learned I could talk , and I had been wearing the same clothes from the moment my sister told me of my new power . <newline> <newline> A chill ran down my spine , and I could feel it growing in strength . There were still moments and moments after that , but they were gone now . The body I inhabited was my body , my mind and consciousness . My mind , my brain , my very being , everything . As suddenly as I awoke , my consciousness was gone . <|endoftext|>
[WP] `` It 's the last time I 'm drinking , and the other boys around here are already fighting . All I need is some whiskey ... '' <|startoftext|> The sound of the bell echoed through the park as the man turned his head to the source of the ringing . He saw the girl in the crowd , but the boy he could feel his heart throbbing with every step in the park . No longer could the boy feel his legs , he could feel his neck , his chest . A hand to the knee , followed by the girl 's other hand . <newline> <newline> And then his vision went black . He opened his eyes to see a woman clutching a flask to her chest , and the man realized he did n't hurt her , but that the woman was bleeding around her neck . The man looked around , seeing the woman 's body , his own as a man . And he found himself with a woman before him , and they began fighting , like men like him . The woman pulled out a pistol , and the man saw a vision of the streets , of men like that . The man saw a girl with a knife in her hand , and the girl began running towards him as the girl screamed for help . He felt the woman pulling her weapon from her body , pulling from her pocket a bottle with a picture of her mother , her eyes closed , and the man realized that she willed his hand to get away and that he felt so much pain , but he did n't feel pain . The man looked around in wonder , seeing everyone get up and try to help . So he walked , the pain gone . <|endoftext|>
[WP] After a very difficult life , someone has finally found happiness . Write from the perspective of the main character , and the author . <|startoftext|> It was the last time I ever saw myself , even after all those failures . I 'm glad I did n't have to find him and help me up . It does n't mean he does n't do anything bad to me . Or worse than he does to everyone else . But I ca n't help it either , every time I go to the store . I 'll never know what happens next . <newline> <newline> Every time he 's there , I have to sit together or just get up and do the same work I 'm doing . Every day I ask myself if I really want this relationship to end . `` Do n't you want it to end ?
