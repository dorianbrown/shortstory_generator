They shouted and cocked back their rifles . <newline> <newline> `` No , hold on , hold on ! '' The monitor read . They looked panicked as they held their rifles to their heads . The room was getting increasingly crowded , as some of the soldiers , carrying their rifles , sat in the end . The man in the room got up and closed the door , holding onto the monitor that now stood in front of him in an empty room for dear life . <newline> <newline> I sighed and checked my surroundings again , this time I looked at my screen . <newline> <newline> `` Yes , sir ?
