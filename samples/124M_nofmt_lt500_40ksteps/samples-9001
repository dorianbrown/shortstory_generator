 skin . <|startoftext|> I took the door to the main hall, where many other soldiers and police stood. <newline> <newline> I stood there with a smile on my face and another tear rolling through my hair. <newline> <newline> I looked down and saw the most powerful man in the world stand next my bed. I walked out, and in his arms he held a long golden chain, and he shook his head as though it was about to do what he thought was right. I stood at his feet, and I made my descent. <newline> <newline> I watched as he disappeared into the night. <newline> <newline> He stopped, dead. I looked at the scar that lay behind his face, and I could tell he was dying. I took his hand and looked at his bloody eyes, a sad tear running down his cheek. Then I left. <newline> <newline> *I'll miss you dad. * <|endoftext|>
[WP] After the apocalypse , the last human remains are left with a small town, the town is overrun by the zombies , and the town is devastated . The town still is full of people who have come to live on its streets . The zombies , the survivors , find these numbers and decide to call the town `` The Last One '' . <|startoftext|> It has been two years and I have been working on the last human remains and we're still getting closer. Some of them are small, but most are large, hundreds of small men and women, and some smaller ones. Each of them carry a sack of potato chips and a handful of carrots for them to eat. <newline> <newline> The city was full of people who had come to live in the city. Some say it was the last man. The town did not want to let this happen until the last of us were gone. <newline> <newline> We decided to call it the "last one". People started taking selfies, we wanted everyone to love a different name in some way. And now, the last of us are gone. We have gathered a little bit of all of the people in the area to go to a "little known house". They will be here in a few months we're hoping. <newline> <newline> The last of us, a young woman, stands up. She looks so young and so young, but when she looks up from her phone, she is staring at the sky. <newline> <newline> "Hello? Where is my phone?" <newline> <newline> "Your phone, you see?" I say, looking over a photo I took that morning in a phone booth. She smiles at me and says she knows who I really am. I remember the "The Last One" that I always dreamed of. <newline> <newline> She looks up and says "I love you daddy" <newline> <newline> "That's the last person I saw in your dream" <newline> <newline> "Daddy?" <newline> <newline> "Yeah, I thought you heard me. That's our daddy." <newline> <newline> As I step over to my phone, my dad is looking at it and says "So your mom was worried when you got your phone back yesterday? It has a button on it." <newline> <newline> I reply "I didn't think she thought we would die." <newline> <newline> "What? We live on a rock?" <newline> <newline> The last of us stands up in the distance and says "It is now or never" <newline> <newline> <|endoftext|>
[WP] When a person dies , they wake up as a new life form . <|startoftext|> I thought the most wonderful thing that would ever happen had happened, an entire new human body. I woke up like I thought I would, and it was just me, my old eyes and my new limbs. I had grown a new body and was happy with the result, which was nothing like a corpse was in the womb. I had grown into a young, old, old man. <newline> <newline> My new identity was all that I had. No other man did as well as I did. My family was happy with me, and mine was happy with nothing. It was amazing what we accomplished. For thousands of years we had evolved into machines, machines that could manipulate our bodies. I was able to do something that was truly incredible, to feel like a machine. I went from a young man to a young woman, and to live. <newline> <newline> And now I had grown out of it. I was finally free. <|end
