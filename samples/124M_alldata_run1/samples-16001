 “ Oh no , I guess you 'll have to come here later if you want to have this time , or '' As my head slammed back into the metal , I heard the door to the room shut . It ’ s always dark in the basement so it just sounded like a small earthquake . * <newline> *As time passes , it becomes clear to me that the man I see today is no longer here . The door to the room is open and a light is starting to dawn on me , so I don ’ t want it to go dark . Instead , I hear him , “ Come over here , ” again , he ’ s starting to speak , “ You ’ ve been here before. ” Before I can say anything else I am pulled across by the shadowing , a hand on my shoulder , pointing my head back and he ’ s coming towards me . I stand up and sit down . He seems very calm , “ Go on now ; I ’ ll take you to the bathroom , ” He takes me back to the basement and I stand behind him . As I slip through the threshold and sit down , I think about the day of , but my mind is racing , trying to figure out all the details of why I was here when you were , or is , a man . I try to think of my future with him but there isn ’ t anything I can think . I have no concept of time . I have no idea of how long it will have taken me to become a man , or even what it feels like after he ’ s gone , but it ’ s just a matter of time . But today is not the day . What will I see of myself tomorrow but perhaps I ’ ll find him again and maybe that will change everything . * <newline> *I hope your memory is okay , I will keep you company no matter how long I go . I look back at you as you are . I hope that your life is good , and in fact there has been good so far . Good . Good . Good . I will never forget you . Good . * <newline> <newline> I leave the room . <newline> <newline> After what feels like an eternity , I walk into the middle of the small , black hallway that is a small room , but I can see it through the thick curtains of the large room . *My mind says that the door to the room should be locked and my brain states that I can just ignore that and go back , but I can ’ t . I can ’ t . How am I going to remember that ? <|endoftext|>
[WP] You are a single grandfather who was killed trying to sell the remains of a house in the 1800 's . The family business goes belly-up when you try to get it back . Then , you accidentally tell the world ... <|startoftext|> ( I 'm going to leave this for another time , but I 'm not a writer , so I 'm okay with not going to work on any of this ) <newline> <newline> <newline> You 'd think the price of a nice house in the 1800 's was more affordable , but really it just meant that you *had* to do it . <newline> <newline> <newline> It was not a house you 'd see again . Just the house of yours . A true old one . A wooden frame . A rocking back door . A single , single , sturdy stone door ; the top of the door had a wooden handle and , as far as my father or mom was concerned , was just a gate , no handle at all . And besides that , it was a house , *or at least a one-way window , * or so they said . <newline> <newline> <newline> We 'd seen lots of houses in town . *In a town ! * There were the wooden pillars , the oak door , the windows ... and no matter how many times you knocked on it , it would just not budge . But here in the 1890 's , when I was just twelve years old , we 'd been trying it . That simple little little trick . Well , if we 'd been young and foolish and wrong , it 's no surprise when we 'd get some kind of surprise after we cracked it open . <newline> <newline> <newline> Our parents were poor , and they worked at the very local butcher . We were n't the only farmers , so that 's how your mom 'd raise you . I 'd always wondered where our parents got their money . Maybe the ones who went to school were really rich , perhaps they 'd find a home here . <newline> <newline> <newline> So we 'd been trying it for years , when a young man ,
