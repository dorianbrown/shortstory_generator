 does a bird , *I hope it ’ s a bird . * <newline> <newline> “ It ’ s a bird , ” the old voice says from the other side of the door . ‘ Not a bird you know. ’ <newline> <newline> “ I know , ” I reply , closing the door . “ I think not a bird ’ s a bird at all . I know you ’ re a bird . *But a bird isn ’ t a bird . It ’ s a bird . It ’ s a bird . * I don ’ t know why I can get mad at something so simple as my own damnation. ” <|endoftext|>
[WP] You are the world 's second best assassin . You 've killed over 2000 people and gained every secret agent your country has ever needed to successfully carry out the missions , but you 've forgotten one secret : you enjoy it . <|startoftext|> I can hear him through all the doors and every door . The screams , the screams , I love them all . I could do with some more of that madness . <newline> <newline> His feet are moving faster in the hallway . He 's walking a lot faster than I 've seen him move with his back to a door . He 's moving so fast his knees are shaking . It 's a dangerous place . <newline> <newline> He stops after I see him coming through the door . `` I 'm going to enjoy it . '' <newline> <newline> `` I will not . '' He 's a bit taller than I used to know about , and I think he 's older or just more intimidating to my side . I do n't remember ever seeing him that way . <newline> <newline> He 's gone , but I ca n't move much . That 's because I am still sitting . It 's my job , and I really , really want him to be dead . <newline> <newline> `` I will be dead soon . I 'll end you all now . '' <newline> <newline> I can hear him going up again . His breathing hard with every breath . He 's about three feet tall . He looks really intimidating . I see him as he comes around my doorway again . His face is puffy and his eyes is closed . I do n't think I could hold them open for him . <newline> <newline> I take one look and I 'm done . <newline> <newline> His last few steps are as painful as he does n't have the courage to kill people and have to get up and face an agent back home , but I do n't care , because all I can think about is killing somebody . I 'm too easy on my little girl . <|endoftext|>
[ CW ] Write a 200-500 word story using a set during the fall , and then a 250-500 word story using a spring . <|startoftext|> They used to tell us that the Great Flood happened in the early year of 1642 . They told us that God came to Earth in a dream , and that His face appeared on the back of the earth . They told us the flood did n't take anything of value from His creation . The Great Flood never happened , and the earth was left in great turmoil . No man in those days had the wealth to save the Earth from itself , and they spent what little they had on a whim . <newline> <newline> They claimed they 'd invented a way to use the power of these machines , to allow man to save what little man could from the Infinite . Of course they had , of course . They said they could bring about a better world with what they did . They told us they 'd never come to give the world more power , because they were tired . They promised us that they 'd never be alone . <newline> <newline> They could have been wrong , and there is nothing we can do about that . We ca n't save them all , but we do n't have the technology needed . <newline> <newline> Instead , we tell a story about a world where everyone is the world , and the world is the world . We 're a story about a place and a time , but it 's never the same story that it 's told . Where did we go wrong ? <|endoftext|>
