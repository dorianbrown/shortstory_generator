 discovery would be so much more . You 've always wondered how this day would be - if we could have made this so ... more . But now , on this day is no longer the day we 've had so long to think about . <newline> <newline> It had always been so beautiful , you see . It 's almost as though the way you 've always loved the way you 're always loved was changed , and that way has always been forever altered . It 's still there , and though it is nothing I 've ever said , you 're probably just too tired . You 're in a position where you can only be yourself . You 've just been sitting in the corner , staring at you with pure , calm , emotionless joy , when the sun finally sets . <newline> <newline> Well you know how it feels to stand in the corner for me right now . But there is no way you 're going to let it ruin your day . I do n't like that . <newline> <newline> You 're going to be the happiest I ever was . <|endoftext|>
[WP] I will never understand why I do n't live up to the first line . <|startoftext|> I just have one thing to say . <newline> <newline> `` I 've learned not to be afraid . I always warned you , before I became a Jedi '' <newline> <newline> `` No-no , no-yes , no no ! It 's not my fault , if you get caught , you won , '' said Princess Leia . <newline> <newline> `` I knew . I did the best I could , but I did not know why . I do n't deserve to be punished or had that much experience . I have to do it for something ! '' <newline> <newline> ... <newline> * <|endoftext|>
[WP] SatChat : You know the last person you were in love with ? <|startoftext|> You 're not sure if it 's my last person . I always thought it 's your last one you might have been in love with . You never even knew she was your wife until she hit you in your face . <newline> <newline> Yes , her name was , but she was my last love . <newline> <newline> She never left her house . I never heard the sound of the door being knocked . She was just going through a routine routine that she was supposed to do all the time . Once she started doing the routine routine , she would just come back out , and pick me up and walk away , not realizing that it was me . I never ever realized how many years I spent in love with her . <newline> <newline> Now , I just want her to know in the end she is the one I 'm dating . She was never too old , never too old , never too old . You never know when you 're going to have sex with her . <newline> <newline> And that 's how I found myself after this story . <|endoftext|>
[WP] You spend time alone with your girlfriend , and she turns out to be completely napping . <|startoftext|> She stood up and started to walk back upstairs . <newline> <newline> `` He 's awake ?

How can I know if I 'll be late ? I do n't even know if we have sex . '' She asked . `` I know , Mom . Mom is sick . Shouldn't I have a new car ? '' I said . `` She 's dead . She probably got into some traffic accident . '' She said . `` You might , but you wo n't be here for two more hours . '' <newline> <newline> `` I have no regrets . I 've been a pretty lucky girl ... '' I exclaimed . `` You just wanted to be at the beach the whole time ! '' <newline> <newline> `` Why is this ? '' I asked . `` Because you said she was napping . But it turns out she was napping when I asked her to walk . You know ... `` we call it '' . <newline> <newline> `` Sorry Mom , but I just forgot ...
