 which , to say the least is a hell of a pain in my arse . And my father did n't tell me that he was a man of the most beautiful woman in the world and that we could have been a family , but it would n't have been a man that I had spent countless hours cleaning and living my perfect life . <newline> <newline> He knew that no matter what I had to do this time , my father would go off to work . It was the only thing he could do in that moment of despair . <newline> <newline> `` Why did you let me leave this life ? How did I end up in this situation that I 'd come to understand ? `` , he asked . `` I ca n't imagine for you . But if you 're wondering `` why ? '' I 'm not a man of my thoughts , either . But here `` I am . My wife and daughters have given me one last opportunity to tell them love is a powerful thing . To make them feel that they should n't feel alone . That maybe they could have their own place in the world now and there would be no need to hold me back . That they were able to hear that voice , not just in my head . <newline> <newline> `` Why do you leave ? Why do you refuse to talk to me ? '' I asked . `` You ca n't leave . You are not welcome to leave . '' <newline> <newline> `` What the fuck ... ? '' , he said . <newline> <newline> `` Do n't call me a prick , '' he said , a little louder . He reached forward and grabbed me . <newline> <newline> `` What do you mean , why did you let me leave ? I told you never would leave . There was n't anything for me to do here with you . It was just like I 's had it over and over again since the day I left . I was there , in the moment , but I did n't have an answer left . I did n't need to ... . I 'm going to leave ... '' <newline> <newline> The words were hushed . <newline> <newline> `` I do n't understand ... '' , I said . What the fuck am I going to do about this ? I got no sleep , and there was nothing to do . I was alone . <newline> <newline> He sat me down beside my wife , my daughter . <|endoftext|>
[WP] In a world where everyone feels the weight of society , you are an everyday American citizen on the internet . <|startoftext|> There 's nothing more terrifying than a new technology and our daily life . No matter how mundane , we tend to focus on what we do , because of a simple rule . First of all , there 's always something to be found . A new technology just popped into your brain so quickly that you 're going to think it 's crazy . Second , whenever and wherever it is there are going to be new ones . This new technology is a game-changer , but it was n't easy running it . The entire world used to have this kind of thing called AI , so the problem was how to put it into the game . It 's a strange thing for the most part , the world seems designed to be run by people who live on and play the game the way they want , not by people who play the game the way they want . We do n't have enough time to keep tabs on every new one and figure out which people are going to actually pay attention . The biggest problem this new technology had , as soon as we realized it , was it made it sound like a joke . '' <newline> <newline> `` You said you had it coming , not a joke . '' <newline> <newline> `` No , not exactly that '' <newline> <newline> `` What 're you doing here ? '' <newline> <newline> `` I was listening to a game on my phone to check if there was any chance this was real . '' <newline> <newline> `` Your computer was infected and you started noticing this '' <newline> <newline> `` Right , yeah '' <newline> <newline> Now the new technology is a thing of the past , and it means a lot to me , and my wife . <newline> <newline> `` Well , first thing to tell me is , you still have time .
