[WP] You live in a world that no man has ever known exists . As a result , no scientist could ever discover the existence of your universe 's final and deepest of end games . <|startoftext|> `` It 's going to be bad . '' <newline> <newline> That 's what my mother always told me . Everytime we go to the playground , he would have just asked me `` Are you going to go to the next round or do you think you 're going to play in the last one ? '' . <newline> <newline> It was something he always did n't listen to . <newline> <newline> `` It 's a fucking trap , '' he told me with a look of realization in his eyes . <newline> <newline> `` Why is it going to be bad ? '' <newline> <newline> I always asked him that ; ask for anything at all . He always did this one thing instead , and did say , `` It 's not me , '' `` I do n't have a choice , '' or `` I do n't care about you . '' <newline> <newline> I ask of him again and again , every time the same sentence . I ask him that one question , that 's the one he always answered when I asked him to be friends with the other boy . <newline> <newline> `` You 're a monster . '' <newline> <newline> At that moment he was different , he did something so stupid no one would know what he did . He threw up all over me and my friends . We watched him burn them all with gasoline and burn them all with what we thought was fire . <newline> <newline> `` I 'm a monster . '' <newline> <newline> `` You 're not a monster . '' <newline> <newline> We had a few fun times back in class , with the class bully , before we decided he was too much of a burden to ignore . <newline> <newline> `` I could save you , '' said the man with a sad face . <newline> <newline> `` So why do n't we go play in the last game , now ? '' <newline> <newline> I asked about the last one . <newline> <newline> After we got home we were so much happier and I finally managed to leave home for summer vacation and come back a few days later to the place where we all were waiting for our class to go away . <newline> <newline> `` I got sick to my face . I 'm going to go play games , do n't try to beat me up . '' <newline> <newline> That is what we would tell ourselves , every time we talked about the rest of that day . It was so easy . He was still a little bit too big , but the rest of the class was smaller . We all got in our cars , I went to the next one , then my brothers went out , and it happened to all of us , that we just stood there , waiting for our class to go away . <newline> <newline> I 'm so sorry . <|endoftext|>
[WP] Aliens , after making first contact , make first contact with earth , and they 're more technologically advanced ( in concept , anyway ) than we 'll ever be . <|startoftext|> `` I think we should do some more to study them , get back at them , '' he said , staring out at blue planet . `` It 's been so long since we have even thought of contact with other intelligent life . '' <newline> <newline> The room was silent . `` How can they not even get a decent picture of us ? '' he growled . <newline> <newline> `` I know , I know . They appear primitive and primitive . I have been listening to them radio-talks . '' <newline> <newline> In just a few minutes , they would be making contact . They would be making diplomatic contact . <newline> <newline> But as it was , they would only contact in secret . It would take no more than a few days until they were in contact with the public . <newline> <newline> `` It is going to happen now . '' he said calmly . `` We are going to communicate . '' <newline> <newline> He waited for the other species , the ones who had called the whole exercise in a bad omen . `` It is time for us to do so , now . '' he said , his voice rising in pitch . He would n't make it
