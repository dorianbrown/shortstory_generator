 then like it did last week , I woke up in a hospital , no IV nor a needle . I tried to call , but no calls came . <newline> <newline> No , no , that 's not it . A person just fell and landed on her face . <newline> <newline> That 's all it took . <newline> <newline> No I want to leave this body . <newline> <newline> I 've wanted this body , I 've been trying . <|endoftext|>
[WP] All the life forms in the galaxy are immortal , but death does not affect them . Humanity will get bored once more , until they finally reach the end . <|startoftext|> `` The universe has its fair share of problems . '' said the old man . <newline> <newline> `` Oh , I know . They 're never as good as they should have been . But I think that the universe will be a better place for the humans . '' <newline> <newline> `` Why do you think life forms are better than we are ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Life as we know it , is dead . '' <newline> <newline> `` But we 're not a part of the universe . '' <newline> <newline> `` We are . '' <newline> <newline> `` So the universe could n't make life better without us . '' <newline> <newline> The old man did n't notice the gesture . He just shrugged and walked away . He had to do it all for his children . He could n't find the right one . <newline> He looked up at the stars to his friends who watched him . He did n't even know what he was making out to . He just could n't . <newline> <newline> `` What do you mean ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Life is going to be better for the humans by the day it is done . '' <newline> <newline> The old man 's face grew more wrinkled as he laughed . The smile grew to a mask of rage . <newline> <newline> `` I said 'better ' ! '' <newline> <newline> There was a scream and the man was thrown backwards onto the ground . <newline> <newline> He was n't going to tell everyone , he had to kill . He had no choice . He had to kill the whole family . He did n't need to watch his children die . He would kill them if he was caught . <newline> <newline> `` Let 's find the one . '' <newline> <newline> The old man picked up the little red dot and sat down across from him . He 'd have to get away from her . <|endoftext|>
[WP] You 're an employee in a movie theater , you 'll be returning to the lobby before a very important customer gets there . When talking to the security , you 'll notice that the man that is responsible for protecting the movie theater has his head completely shaved and he 's about to pull out his gun . <|startoftext|> `` So , Mr. Johnson , there 's something I can help you with ... '' <newline> <newline> Johnson had a rather disconcerting look on his face . He was n't sure why , but he wanted to look like his best friend . Johnson wanted to look like the son of a bitch of a lawyer . A good friend because he thought it was a good friend . Johnson wanted to smile . Johnson wanted every single thing he was going to think about the next day for the rest of his life . <newline> <newline> He pulled out his handgun from his pocket to pull it out . He looked around and noticed that everyone he was meeting was in the same area , a movie theater , and a very , very busy movie theater . He looked at the other patrons . His gun was pointed to the ceiling . <newline> <newline> The door to the movie theater opened , with a bright light , and an old man in a very long robe walked into the theater . The woman across from him stepped up , stepped on top of their seats , stepped out of the shadows and looked at Johnson . Her eyes widened , as she recognized his face . `` Johnson , are n't you going to be the best part tonight ? '' Johnson asked with a nod . `` You were the one that will be the best part , right this moment . '' The old man in the robe smiled , the kind of smile you 've got when you 've got too much to discuss in your first two or three years in a theater . `` Thank you for helping me with that .
