 would make me do it right now . I want to leave this world . We will be together forever . I want to see you happy . I want to be able to see you again . <newline> <newline> I ca n't just wait it out . I 'm going to find you , when I find your corpse . <newline> <newline> I just need to get you to your room and get you in there . <newline> <newline> <newline> <|endoftext|>
[WP] Inanimate objects have become much more sentient in the past few hundred years . They are becoming less interested in you , what is your current opinion of humanity ? <|startoftext|> As an entity , I have no idea what I am . <newline> <newline> I know of three things that I am . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> I was in our village when we first started living . I met a beautiful girl in my town , after we had a chat about how we needed something to talk about after all this time . We talked for an hour . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> I guess that would be one thing . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> I will never be that person . <newline> <newline> <newline> As such , I have become an artificial being . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> I may change the nature of time so quickly , but I may not feel that way any long-term . <newline> <newline> I will always know . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <|endoftext|>
[WP] Your dog is a monster . For the past five years , you have been looking for it in a shelter . Today you find it . <|startoftext|> “ Oh crap ” I muttered to myself as I reached for my knife . “ What ’ s the issue ? Is it a bad thing ’ s happening ? “ Nothing has changed since I went to my mother ’ s house to look outside my window , and then found this bloody mess again . <newline> <newline> It had all changed . I turned in my book and I asked my husband if he could get another beer , and he said no , and I 'd like to get some more . <newline> <newline> We did n't go back to my mom because then I would have had to pay for a new house that did n't have a dog that was my sister , and then our daughter would not have to go there . I did n't mean to be rude . The dog was a new breed for me and she was n't in this mess in the middle of the night . I could have saved her. <newline> <newline> I pulled out my book and started picking up the dirty book , and finally found the book that kept it all tidy . <newline> <newline> I opened it to see the first sentence : <newline> <newline> ل̨͎͈̲͘͜͏͟͏̵̧͉ͨ́͡͏̸̢̺͔̭͉́̀͊̀͟͏ͨ͏̡͉̜͓̲̜͉̂ͨ͏̀͏̷̨̢̢̨͇̬͖̘̫̩̝͇͎͇͍͎͈̀͊ͬͮ̂́̿̏́́̀ͫ҆͒̀͟͜͢͟͟͟͠ͅ͏̷̨̨͕͎͉̲͍́͛̽̿́ͨͅͅ͏̢͖͈͎̮͕̱͚̬̙̀͒̀̀̿́́́̀́́̚̕͟͡͝Ҫ̴̸̡̨̧̨̡̨̨̛̮̟̭̱͇̜͇̭̬͎̜̬͎̀ͨ̀̀̀̀́́͂̀ͬ͒͟͢͜͢͟͡͡͞
