 to find new planets for colonization . `` Well , I think I 've found a planet of my name '' <|endoftext|>
[WP] A zombie virus sweeps the nation , causing a new generation of zombies to emerge from the sewers <|startoftext|> `` The virus , is spreading . '' I said , `` It 's going to spread . It takes a number of months for things to do this kind of thing . You ca n't let it spread on the whole nation . '' <newline> The others looked at me like I was some sort of insane . The government was worried about this kind of thing , but there 's a lot of panic in the heads of zombies . There are a few who still did n't trust their government , I 'm on the list of the paranoid . <newline> <newline> `` What does it do ? '' asked a man . <newline> <newline> `` I do n't have all the answers . '' I said , `` We do n't know who it is . '' <newline> <newline> `` Is it a virus ? '' The man asked . <newline> <newline> `` It 's a virus , now is n't it ? Its something that can be injected . It 's in people 's body , in their saliva , their blood . It can take years for the body to get rid of that virus . '' I said , `` The government has enough resources , even in a nuclear wasteland . Let 's just let some of our guys spread it , and hopefully this will kill them ... '' <newline> <newline> A few questions went through the heads of those who were dumbfounded . I knew there would be no shortage of weapons , and supplies in the war-zone , but it would make the virus take a while for the zombie apocalypse to get out of control . <newline> <newline> `` Look . What else was reported is in your area ? Are you going to send the troops to fight it ? '' The man said , `` It 's taking a few weeks for them to adapt . '' <newline> <newline> `` There 's a lot of time , there 's a lot of supplies , I wo n't lose them '' I said . <newline> <newline> Then I was standing outside St. Mary 's hospital , in a time I 'd never imagined . A few thousand people , a few thousand zombies , and a few thousand who did n't trust me . It was n't the last time they saw the truth . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <|endoftext|>
[WP] A man falls in love with a zombie . <|startoftext|> There was always a time when he would spend his Sundays as a mindless zombie . He was free to roam as he was in his mind . And there were those who were more patient , even if they needed him more . In these new times , many people , who have taken lives and lost others , never had access to these kinds of zombies , so they were rarely asked . <newline> <newline> It was for the best of those people , he thought as he slowly turned on the TV to look at the news . He was sure he would always be watching , for the days when he could roam his mind in these new and unfamiliar times . <newline> <newline> That 's when it happened , it was almost 4am . A television screen had turned green . <newline> <newline> `` Hello , I am Rick Grimes . I am now , the world is ending , all things have returned . My name 's Rick Grimes . I am a zombie . Why am i here ? '' <newline> <newline> `` How about this ... '' said Grimes , as he took a drink from his mug , he looked at the screen again , with a new expression on his face . `` I am Rick . Why am I ... '' <newline> <newline> He had no idea why this was happening until the news reported zombie-type incident in New York City . The first reports of zombies in America were of people falling to their death , but never before had this been reported . However when reports of the first outbreak in New York , first and people started calling it , and only on the news were the dead , many were thought to be only people in their 20 's , who went to the hospital , only to die after being eaten . <newline> <newline> Then the second outbreak in New York happened only a few weeks later . People were only eating people before the epidemic started , before that there were only two outbreaks in the cities . One in New York and one in Chicago , and the second outbreak in Chicago killed millions of people . None of the people who died in Chicago
