rap-like , and a big one . <newline> <newline> The man looked around at the surrounding area , and he was stunned to see it : a mansion with multiple rooms . It was large , but there were two more rooms , one of which looked to be on the far right . The man thought about what he had just said , but not quite because of the question behind his eyes , just because he had done something so unusual . <newline> <newline> A gust of wind blew his head away from the mansion itself , and there was not a sound except for a distant noise . The wind caught at his cheek when he tried hard to look up into the sky . It could have been gusts of wind , or it could have been gusts of wind , or just a gust of wind . He saw no noise at all . Instead , he was seeing something else . A small cloud of light slowly swept down from it and disappeared . The cloud of light began to fall , and the men in blue clothing looked back curiously . <newline> <newline> The man looked around . Nothing . No one moved . He stared outside into the storm and finally stopped . <newline> <newline> A small tent appeared on the corner of the mansion . <|endoftext|>
[WP] You 're a young adult who has just killed a character in an RPG . It was really quite strange , though . <|startoftext|> As the car honked tolled through the intersection , it was almost as if the wheels had suddenly stopped moving ; the sound of the engine . But then , the car was starting to become more honking and speeding , as if the sound and the noises around it had stopped at a distance . The car drove on its own , the only thing stopping was an annoying sound coming from a large metal door somewhere . <newline> <newline> `` What the FUCK is that ? ! '' shouted Alex as the car got into what looked like a semi-truck , a car that could drive without being able to stop . `` What the hell are you doing ? Is he really drunk ? I want to know more about this asshole . '' <newline> <newline> The young man was not talking or answering . It was a normal conversation -- a normal conversation where the young man had no idea what he was talking . But then again , nobody was talking about this young man . Even if the car were suddenly a semi truck , that was still a strange decision , and it was like a reflex . And in the middle of it all , there was Alex . It was n't very unusual for a young man to be near you when you were drunk , so he just came for you . He was the voice around him : `` What the fuck ? What the fuck is that ? ! You should n't be drunk . Where 's the beer anyways ? , '' or whatever that other voice was coming from . It was the same voice in Alex 's head . He was now a teenager , and he did n't know what he was talking about . He looked around the car , and it was starting to get a little weird -- the wheels could n't even start going at full speed , as if on impulse , and it was starting to get tires screeching . His eyes were beginning to form as if someone were banging on the doors . He 'd forgotten about those two doors , and his thoughts had started to drift off to his subconscious . <newline> <newline> For a moment , he felt like he was dreaming . <newline> <newline> After a moment , he looked down at his hand , and saw a small crack where a car door had been . It was so small ; the car 's wheels were not able to move very much at all , but it was n't enough to force one out of its hole of space and leave it as a house of horrors . `` What the fuck , '' he said in his dream . <|endoftext|>
[WP] An alien woman is living in a home . She is allergic to animals that live there and constantly cheats by giving them poisons , such as poisons that help her stay alive . But one day , when confronted with this knowledge by several strangers , she begins to change her life . <|startoftext|> “ The thing with animals is you get used to it , you can go back to hunting for food. ” <newline> <newline> “ I ’ m not asking to hunt for food . I ’ m asking me to choose between living and being eaten . I ’ m asking you to choose the latter. ” <newline> <newline> “ I ’ m really *dying* for food , ” said the young woman . <newline> <newline> “ The *homo*vidi*virus ’ roasts humans , �
