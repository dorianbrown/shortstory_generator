ï¿½ `` So the guy who 's here right now is a bit more 'real ' than you 'd believe . I mean I like you a lot . But he 's not the greatest buddy . And maybe I can 've got him out of your mind . '' <newline> <newline> He turned back . `` Do you think they 're all real ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Probably not . But you do n't have the right word to describe them . I 'm a little bit more sure of that than most . Anyway , the best thing you do for you right now is avoid him completely . That 's all you ask me . '' <newline> <newline> `` And what 's your reason ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Do you think that guy makes that kind of guy out of anybody ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Probably not . I mean the thing is I do n't think he is . I 'd say he 's a friend . He 's probably a friend to you . '' <newline> <newline> `` No . He 's not a friend . No way . And I 'm not sure what that even means . '' <newline> <newline> `` A friend of yours , but I do n't really know what that means . So yeah you probably do n't really like him or whatever he is . '' <newline> <newline> `` Maybe just for giggles he makes a nice guy out of everybody . Just because you know him well . But that 's just not what he is . '' <newline> <newline> So it was just a one-sided conversation . <|endoftext|>
[ IP ] The Girl and the Cup <|startoftext|> She was a woman in the forest . Not a very tall one , really , just a little . Her hair was not that of any animal , but with a long , dark strand . A very dark and dark , very brown , almost black . The color of a soul . She looked away from the branches of the trees at the girl across the path , her eyes on the figure that had the same shade of brown hair that hung down to her wrist in a similar fashion to the sun , and on the cup her white gown sat on . <newline> <newline> She had an air of mystery around her , and the shade of her skin shone through the trees . As she entered the woods , she found the forest had been a different scene to the one before . The trees had been a little bit more wild now , and the grass had been less crisp . The air hung thick with the scent of a fresh flower and of a wild plant , and her clothes lay in pajamas in a heap beside her head , not as soft or firm as the skin would have you believe . <|endoftext|>
[WP] The day your mother died . <|startoftext|> I hear the sound of my mother 's funeral . I hear the mournful sound of her last breath . And as I 'm walking down the aisle my heart breaks in half . <newline> <newline> I take a step towards my mother . I am still scared , this woman who was so caring will never be the same . I turn around to hug my mother , she is smiling at me , I know we are going to be alright together . <newline> <newline> * '' Thank you for everything mommy ... You are the bestest thing to ever happen to me . `` * <newline> <newline> I take another step backwards , but this time I hear a sharp smack from behind me . My mother looks up at me , then to my father . He was silent for a second , but turned to face me with tears in his eyes . <newline> <newline> * '' So sorry . `` * <newline> <newline> My father hugs me again . My mother 's body begins to rise , her head spins with the rising waves . My father stands , looking at me the most sad thing he has ever seen . <newline> <newline> * '' I 'm sorry my boy , but you will no longer live in this world as I did . `` * <newline> <newline> My father looks down upon the body , his tears slowly rolling down his cheeks . We are only going to survive this planet for ten more years . I still remember my mother crying after she lost her first baby . How that baby stayed with me till his death . How my father made me cry . <newline> <newline> The rest of my family is gone now . My sister left with him , leaving me to care for my sister alone in the afterlife . My best friend left as well , my parents are gone . My father did not leave me with any
