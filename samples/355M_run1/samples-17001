The neighborhood was quiet . There were no cars for miles . It was peaceful . I could n't really feel happiness like this . It was in the air . It floated around us . I looked up at the house . I remembered walking by on Sunday . It was Sunday again . My mom was walking by the house when I came into the street . I stopped , but did n't look towards the house . The street was empty .
