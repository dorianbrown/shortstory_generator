 in the room where their first night together . I look over at my husband who appears to have been holding a box of matches . `` Oh , and the rest ? Good girl . '' <newline> <newline> I know the matches look a little less promising than before he left and my husband does n't look nearly as good at it . But , I 'm glad there are more then two of them now . If I 'm going to sleep tonight , I might as well go . I 'm going to sleep with one of them . And as to never screw with my lover again , that 's something I 'm pretty sure he knows . <newline> <newline> I look at them as they step in the door . The two older men walk in and start on their way up the stairs , the door open and there they go . <newline> <newline> `` Honey , you 've got ta come with me. `` <newline> <newline> I hear the door open and as I get up they have two of them with them . It 's time . I can smell their love for one another but I ca n't be sure . It 's good to see them again , and I hope they will love each other too . I walk in with my suitcase with my two in tow and take those big bags of matches , all in hand and look at my house , I 'm really going to miss it . <newline> <newline> It seems like I 've only got a minute left . I start walking down the halls to reach my kitchen and grab another . <newline> <newline> `` Hey guys , I got this pack of Match 's in my suitcase for the nights shift - we do n't have to stay in there for the money I 'm saving with what I did. `` I look at the girls before me before my eyes are filled with disappointment and regret . <newline> <newline> I keep walking until I 'd found the bathroom . I 'm not sure if they even know what a restroom is . I walk into the bathroom to see one of my friends . He does n't look that different from her . <newline> <newline> <|endoftext|>
[WP] You 're part of a human team sent to conquer a newly discovered alien species . Upon arrival , they discover a message in the language of one of human languages . `` This is the planet you will colonize . You can not leave until you have conquered it , '' the alien says . <|startoftext|> `` This is ... this is where it all started . '' I told the alien about the planet I named Earth . `` And this is how things happen , really . '' <newline> <newline> `` Well ? You came here with us as your whole species . You got us as an ally .

He had been sent here as part of the species at war , for their entire race , and as a result was part of the galaxy . The alien could n't be here if they wanted to live , he had been left here . His people wanted and he had to live . If they fought the aliens , they would die . This is why . There would be no war , they did n't expect . I took it back to myself , I thought , I said , I would find some way to stop him . But they always ... always ... come into my space . Always , without purpose , without even warning . And the aliens ... those aliens ... it just ... they ... looked at me , and said , `` I love you . I 'll ... I '
