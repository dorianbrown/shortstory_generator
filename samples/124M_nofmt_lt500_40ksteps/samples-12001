 <newline> <newline> And they will not have found a way to save us. <newline> And the same is my legacy, <newline> <newline> to make it a more complete place. <newline> <newline> <newline> I've traveled around the world <newline> With everyone I've met, <newline> The same as the ones I've had meet ; <newline> And my work is just as strong, <newline> The people who I've met here, <newline> are only that I know. <|endoftext|>
[WP] A man dies who goes to a mental institution expecting an explanation <|startoftext|> <newline> I had a good feeling in there. My wife was crying and I felt bad for her. I could have been there, maybe I wouldn't die of a heart attack if it weren't for the people around me. They just stood watching the world around them, I just didn't see the point in being the hero. I could have gone out in public and given the police a few minutes before I'd get a proper explanation for how I ended up in a mental institution. I certainly won't get one, my heart wouldn't even let me go. <newline> <newline> My family looked over, shocked by my choice. I took what felt like a lifetime to think about. How could I have come to be here, if that was the way it was supposed to go. Wasn't it important that I had to get the mental health thing right though, to take a good look around the whole place, check every room, make sure every single bed was clean. <newline> <newline> They started to wonder, could there really be another me? I sighed and put down the pills that I had bought the day the accident happened. <|endoftext|>
[WP] There is always a winner . One winner can change history . The world laughs as a number of nations come to a collective consensus regarding the amount of people who deserve a place in the human race . <|startoftext|> The great leaders of the world agreed. The leaders of the world agreed. And for all their differences and differences, this shared understanding led to a mutual understanding. <newline> <newline> The leaders of the world held up the same red flag. A red flag that they signed themselves to a planet. Each of their leaders were one or the other. Each of them had a different point of view. With this flag, they agreed to leave behind a world that would live on. <|endoftext|>
[WP] You are a genie and the universe is only interested in granting your one wish , but you have other wishes that you wish for more specific . <|startoftext|> It's late. The sun is getting to the city, and the skies are getting darker all over in an attempt to keep the darkness from peeking into the sky. <newline> <newline> "Hey, there's been a great run at our fair! They can't beat us down!" <newline> <newline> "No, but that's not what I wish for, I wish I could change the world!" <newline> <newline> "So you think I don't look like it?" <newline> <newline> The man sighs and nods his approval. "That is true. But for a man who wants to save the world from the evils of capitalism, the burden is daunting. I'm sure you thought it through." <newline> <newline> "You can look up an account here for a free gift in exchange for a change of scenery." <newline> <newline> "I don't see..." <newline> <newline> The men stare intently at the old man's face. He stands up, puts his hand on the man's shoulder and hands the man a bag of Doritos. "Oh, I just thought I'd ask some friends about a great change of scenery! And it's actually going to give me a chance for a better future!" <newline> <newline> "I'm not quite sure why you're asking me. But I've always wanted more." <newline> <newline> "We shouldn't have talked this much! At least not about the guy, the good guy. If I'm going to save the world, I don't want anyone to kill me!" <newline> <newline> The man takes the bag of Doritos and puts it on the mans shoulder too. "Well?" <newline> <newline> "I suppose not. I haven't really liked saving the world." <newline> <newline> The man grins and moves on. He hands the bag to the man. "
