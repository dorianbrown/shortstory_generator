 The way out of the city was a blur, and the only way you could walk was by the bridge to the city. In the city was a small, but bustling business district, with plenty of shops, restaurants, and even restaurants. I'd been to a few, and this was one of my many trips to these places many times. <newline> <newline> People kept to themselves when they wanted, as I had. They would go out to eat at a restaurant and go outside to eat. It gave them lots of time before they would even arrive. It could be a lot of fun. <newline> <newline> At some point, a man said to everyone "It won't hurt, my wife never gets to see us". As he was talking to me, I realized that at a certain point people wouldn't actually be here to stay. They would stay here and live the rest of their lives in the city while I did. <newline> <newline> I felt something strange, and I couldn't tell anyone. I couldn't even see people, but I couldn't explain it to anyone but myself. I had to explain it to everyone. <newline> <newline> Then I had a thought. It must have happened, because the people who came back were the most eager I had ever seen. This was the time that they'd found me. This was the time that I would be the one that found them. <newline> <newline> My eyesight was failing. <|endoftext|>
[WP] It 's the year 3000 . Write a farewell speech for one of the world 's greatest philosophers , scientist , and other such luminaries . <|startoftext|> In all our efforts to advance civilization in this time, we will be judged by the last line of our work for our purposes. Our actions were calculated to harm the most basic human civilization in the history of humanity. It didn ’ t make sense however, that we shouldn ’ t take the time to study and appreciate things with regard to human morality, justice and the proper role of human life. <newline> <newline> As we all have done since our first discovery, we have strived to advance mankind ’ s understanding of the concept of morality. The vast majority of mankind believes in free and rational thought and thought allows for freedom. We have developed the first self sustaining society, one that is able to provide these benefits to society. We have brought the concept back to every society and society we knew could benefit. We will use all our methods to promote our advancement, to help humanity become a species of intelligent and just beings capable of living happily, and to ensure that we become the most important and unique beings on the Earth. <newline> <newline> <|endoftext|>
[WP] You have `` Memory Lapse Syndrome '' . The symptoms are overwhelming . <|startoftext|> "No, that's not correct" <newline> I can never tell you what was on my mind that day. I was on a busy business trip to see my father and girlfriend of a couple years, whom I had a crush on just yesterday. All I know is that I had spent some time with the two of them, at least. <newline> <newline> "I'm sorry, how was I supposed to remember today?" I mumbled to myself. There was no way I could do this sort of thing with such a perfect memory. The world had begun to move forward. It could not be. It just wasn't possible. <newline> <newline> "What happened?" I mumbled, slightly to the side. <newline> <newline> "Nothing really happened" I explained the details. I don't have time for this sort of thing. I just can't seem to remember anything, even if I know. I was just looking at the past of a young man who passed away a decade or so ago, and I was so close. <newline> <newline> I could feel the world moving through my head. All I was truly looking at were a few minutes to a few seconds of my life. I could feel the time passing fast. I was able to go out the door when I felt something. It felt right. Nothing had happened. I could not remember anything. <newline> <newline> "What is it, man?" I wondered. "What is it happening?" <newline> <newline> "It looks like you forgot something, man." He said gently to me. <|endoftext|>
