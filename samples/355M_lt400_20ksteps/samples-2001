[WP] `` You have been killed ? '' <|startoftext|> I am dead . I 'm a living , breathing part of a computer program that controls the body when not in use . One I 've worked on for over 30 years . <newline> The life here has changed from what it used to be . With every human I kill , the system has to recalculate for me : my body cannot survive for that long or any longer . This is the life I spend trying to prevent me from living . Because I 'm the one who controls the system and I know the time is right . <newline> <newline> I never expected they came for me . It should have surprised me . My life has been the worst this planet has come to . Not only did the systems fail me , it killed all the humans . But this time was different . It was different because someone knew who I was . I 'm a perfect example of what human is supposed to be all about . <newline> <newline> But this time was different . I will continue my life not knowing it will be end . I feel so alone . Not because there is no human , even the best of me are no match for humanity . But as humanity evolves , the life I 've lived has no meaning . So for me , this is the end . I 'm going to the grave without a doubt . I 'm sorry for anyone that I have upset . I can only hope that someday humans understand humanity . For me it 's a matter of time . <|endoftext|>
[WP] The first human in history decides to get on the last plane to die . <|startoftext|> `` What was your last wish ? '' He asked , feeling the heat of the sun in his face . <newline> <newline> `` To feel the last of it all of them . They will all go to heaven , but that must be that of a man , not of an animal . '' <newline> <newline> `` If I can see myself , and know that I am now alive , I 'll always have that wish . '' <newline> <newline> The man stood on this plane of existence by himself , watching from his plane . <newline> <newline> He was in pain , his entire body being in pain . The man stood there , thinking about his life . `` Am I alive ? Am I immortal ? '' <newline> <newline> `` It does n't matter to me . I ca n't imagine taking my own life . But I 'm just happy to be there . '' <newline> <newline> The man let out a huff and let his feelings be known . He looked up . '' Am I dead ? '' <newline> <newline> There was a tear in the cloud and in the man ’ s eyes he saw his name , his first , in the sky above him . He did n't look much older , but this was a happy time for the man . He had loved and been loved by all people . <|endoftext|>
[WP] In the near future , technology can allow immortality . One man is granted immortality by using a computer program to run for 100 years . All of time is erased and a man is granted immortality . <|startoftext|> “ Well , I 'll try it if I can . ” <newline> <newline> “ I ca n't do it , I have n't had the will to live in this world at a time , I need to die if I want . ” <newline> <newline> “ If I can get the time to live , it shall be worth the reward, ” <newline> <newline> “ So tell me , man , what 's it like for you ? The time to die has already been gone . ” <newline> <newline> “ It does n't feel like much of you . <newline> <newline> “ Yes , you ’ re getting old. ” <newline> <newline> “ Why ’ s it that when someone dies for the first time they do n't get time to live ? ” <newline> <newline> “ When you say nothing , when you ’ re not able to do anything , ” <newline> <newline> “ Life is always a struggle when someone dies for the first time . ” <newline> <newline> “ You do n't get the opportunity to live as much as you want , ” <newline> <newline> “ It makes no difference , ” <newline> <newline> “ I want to live for as long
