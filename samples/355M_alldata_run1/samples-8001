 out of a hole that the person was going outside , which was quite a large one . The girl seemed terrified , as she was walking into the bright , sunny day . <newline> `` Hello , '' she said , `` this is just me , '' <|endoftext|>
[WP] `` The best time to be a man is not when it 's warm , the best time to be a woman when it 's cold , or when the weather warms up , or when it rains on the last day in June . '' <|startoftext|> I sat down at my desk , sipping my tea from the cup holder next to my desk , staring into the corner of my office . I was starting to think that I should have more to show off my new wardrobe that I had just acquired . <newline> <newline> I pulled up to my desk . No woman was there . My phone buzzed , it was my birthday . I glanced at the date : December 31 , 2016 . On it was my first name 's . I stared at it , and it began to flash on the screen , `` The best time to be a man is not when it 's warm , the best time to be a woman when it 's cold , or when the weather warms up , or when the rain dries the last day in June . '' Now I could see the handwriting . <newline> <newline> A large black and red ink spilled out onto my screen . It was written by a stranger , or someone I have never met , but it was n't exactly exactly a very good handwriting . Even worse than me , was the ink color . My favorite color for ink . If I had a friend I would n't read about it , but it was something that I had seen in movies or read on my own . I could n't remember it , however , so I was stuck with it for now . <|endoftext|>
[WP] You are your favorite character or game of many . <|startoftext|> He was a good guy , a good fighter , and the best companion at best . But the most important thing was that they trusted him , but not enough to kill him for not allowing himself to live up to those ideals . So when she died , they felt responsible . <newline> <newline> Even as the time passed , his body kept getting older and the memories that he kept going through became more and more distant . <newline> <newline> So , as he was dying he left them in what felt like a deathly sleep . <newline> <newline> He was a lonely man , one that nobody could trust . <newline> <newline> I was in the hallway , the hall a few paces and two doors . <newline> <newline> *In the hall , he saw his wife , and a man , dark green eyes . * They had grown old , the man that had long since aged out , his eyes , pale and sunken and empty . *They had never trusted him , never given him such kindness . * <newline> <newline> He was the only man who had seen her in such a way , his eyes were empty , his smile fading slowly into sadness and silence . <newline> <newline> I stared at him , my gaze meeting his gaze . <newline> <newline> I saw the look of disbelief , the confusion seep in his eyes . `` Honey ? '' <newline> <newline> He did n't react , and I knew no one could ever trust him . The man had died too quickly for him , yet , the look on their faces matched the look of surprise on their faces . <newline> <newline> I was still here , still sitting , still in the hall . My eyes met , mine dark , hollow , and a sad sadness washed over me . <newline> <newline> `` Hello ? '' He came , and he could n't help it . <newline> <newline> But he could n't tell me where I was . <newline> <newline> He was always there when I needed him , and I could n't stop it anymore . But it was time that I let him go . <newline> <newline> It was time for him to go for the last time . <newline> <newline> He sat on the other side , and stood and looked me straight in the face , in the direction of his eyes . <newline> <newline> *He closed his eyes for a moment , and then spoke , in a low growl . * <newline> <newline> `` Honey , I love you more than anything anyone else . '' <|endoftext|>
