 friends , they will do so without me . '' <newline> <newline> I nod at him , looking at his face in the mirror as I do my best not to tear down . He does n't see the tear stains on my eye - something about his lips . His eyes are filled with emotion . <newline> <newline> `` They want you . '' I say calmly without looking at him , taking the first step into the world . But his eyes are empty , and he wo n't see me . His eyes are empty , and I 'm gone . <|endoftext|>
[WP] Write a story with a key word . <|startoftext|> “ How ’ s life ’ s been for you today ? ” the little boy inquired , “ Your first day alive ? ” I smiled in response and shook my head . <newline> <newline> <newline> “ It hasn ’ t been well . I do my job , I do my chores , I eat , I sleep. ” He said , and nodded . It was always reassuring . I could tell he was right . I was always the only one at the top of his class . <newline> <newline> <newline> “ I ’ ve grown used to the change. ” I reminded him . “ There still is my job . My house is in the basement . I use some of that money to get as close to those guys , and the other students that come through . There are even more jobs for me. ” <newline> <newline> <newline> He nodded and shook his head again . <newline> <newline> <newline> “ I ’ m bored . I ’ m tired . But , there are still some jobs for me. ” He continued . “ Some jobs are still for my kids. ” I chuckled slightly as he nodded . <newline> <newline> <newline> “ Well that doesn ’ t mean I hate people more . Even the people that do get into things that are stupid . My friends are just so boring . They love their own existence . I could be working at the same bank over and over again for a long time , but it would only drag on until I have the means to retire . It would make me feel good . I wish that were true ! ” He laughed , “ I wish I could retire too. ” I let out a chuckle , “ But not today . Not yet . Maybe tomorrow. ” <newline> <newline> <newline> He nodded , and shook his head . <newline> <newline> <newline> I pulled a letter from my pocket and flipped it over . The one I received was in yellow . It read to me : “ Congratulations on completing your degree. ” And I smiled at my new friend . <|endoftext|>
[WP] You have awoken to find yourself in the world of all fictional characters and races who are not exactly what they appear to be ... <|startoftext|> It was a strange sensation when I awoke . <newline> <newline> I was a child and when I awoke there were creatures with a sort of face . Their eyes , mouths , noses , but mostly the things I had always recognised . <newline> <newline> I had seen the face of one of the beings , one I had even heard stories of before . It was one of those creatures of old , one of those who had a face , and one I did n't . <newline> <newline> It had a body , but it seemed to stay rooted from all around ; like a dead tree , it did n't move at all . It was also very weak . Not even to my right . My right eye was a stone . <newline> <newline> A few minutes passed as the creatures began to move around this body . It had moved to look at me , but there were no eyes in the creature 's face . <newline> <newline> The creature had taken it away from the body and was looking for something inside the face . The creature knew something had happened and wanted to tell me what it had seen . The creature had tried to take away the eyes , but the eyes that I had always assumed belonged in the eyes of those who were looking at us had instead appeared to be on my other side , which meant I could n't see things . So no one was able to get my eyes , so there no one were to help me or make sure I did n't get sick and that there would be nothing that could be done . <newline> <newline> But when the beings left me there were no more of them for me to see . <|endoftext|>
