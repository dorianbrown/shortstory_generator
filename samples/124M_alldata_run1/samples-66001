 his face was wet from embarrassment . I put in a quick prayer before continuing , `` My goodness ! My mother gave me this gift when I was a kid . A gift , she said . It was her most prized possession . '' <newline> <newline> Her voice was a whisper , but the tone was steady , the rhythm of it soothing . `` But now ... now this 'll make you ... this 'll give me hope '' I stood and waited for her to say more - I knew this would make this an easy decision . I could hear her breathing . I began to sob as tears began to fall down her face . <newline> <newline> `` It 's so ... it 's beautiful ... '' she strolled in and embraced me with tears in her eyes , as a new hope began to bloom in her . And when that hope died , I saw the light in her eyes as the world came to a sudden and terrible conclusion . <newline> <newline> I was so excited . She was a beauty that was in such pain , so beautiful . I was a better person . And I could n't stand to see so that I could be so miserable . <newline> <newline> The next day , as the sun set , we sat next to hers in the courtyard . I knew this was the place she would go to meet this new God . I was ready . <newline> <newline> When she came to me , and I saw the scars in her hand , the scars on her face as I saw those dark corners in her eyes , I could n't wait to meet her face with that man with all of his scars as I looked in her eyes . <newline> <newline> As a symbol of my faith , that man with the scars held me by the shoulders as I looked into hers . I did not know how to say it , but I did all I could to comfort her . <newline> <newline> `` It 's so beautiful ... '' her eyes welled with tears as she choked back the words . `` It 's so ... it 's just my favourite thing ever , even though it hurts . '' The look of wonder around her showed me a tear as I looked up into her eyes . She smiled and I did n't realize how beautiful she was until the sound of the rain had stopped . I ran straight to the ground and turned to help the fallen . <newline> <newline> `` It 's like everything in the world comes to a stop '' I turned and looked to her . `` It stopped at the corner where you left it , just barely , right in between us . '' <newline> <newline> She looked sad . I was sad . I could see the anger building inside of her as she looked back at the rain . My heart filled with joy again as I looked back at her . <newline> <newline> `` It 's so beautiful , but the thing that keeps you from love , that makes you forget who you are , is that you are a monster , and we ca n't stop it . It 's like we 're holding you back . All for one thing . Because it hurts so much . '' She hugged me tightly , the tears finally falling . `` It 's just.. it 's just so.. it 's just so beautiful.. '' and she continued , `` it 's just ... it 's just ... . '' <newline> <newline> Tears began to flow again as the rain turned to red as it began . Her face became soft , her hands became soft , and her hair began to blur as she started to turn pale . I could n't believe it - she had turned a shade so dark I could barely see them , and then her eyes opened . She looked at me and smiled at me , her face red enough to bruise , and I knew she could n't bear it . <newline> <newline> As the drops hit the pavement , I fell onto my knees , gasping for the words . `` Please help me - '' the sound of gasps could be heard from the street . `` Please ... . '' I began to cry into my hands , but stopped when she stopped , and before I could see any of her tears it was already too late . <newline> <newline> It was over <|endoftext|>
[WP] On their 18th birthday , a child is assigned their worst enemy . It has never been more clear than now , walking naked in the street . <|startoftext|> I always wondered how she always came out the victor over her parents . They were so angry and jealous and they had nothing left in them . They were so sad , and lonely . <newline> <newline> But when they came and they stood there looking at their best friend , they would just look at their worst enemy and whisper in his ears .
