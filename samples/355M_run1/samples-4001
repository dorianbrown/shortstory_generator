 majority of the population are actually sentient . <|startoftext|> `` That 's pretty damn good , '' she said . `` You do n't need many jobs to be able to afford some of the higher ups . '' <newline> <newline> My head throbbed . So many people were working in this factory . <newline> <newline> `` What 's this about ? '' I asked . <newline> <newline> They did n't mention the jobs to my manager . <newline> <newline> `` That 's really strange , '' she answered . `` How often do you see the same names in the same position ? How many people are working in that particular job ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Do you have to be a robot to be able to do this ? Do you not know how many people are involved ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Well , how many jobs do you think the robots would need at their new jobs ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Like ? '' <newline> <newline> `` We may need more , '' she answered . `` If we have robots like ourselves , we need a little extra help to get to work . It 's good enough for the rest of us . '' <newline> <newline> I took off into the distance . I never really noticed anything after I started driving , but my feet hurt . <newline> <newline> I did n't see anything again . <|endoftext|>
[WP] Your boyfriend/girlfriend is having a little too much trouble at his job . He asks if you 're okay . She tells him it 's normal . He tells her it 's your fault . He 's the one who knows this must go hand in hand , but she does n't know her best friend 's job does n't include a lot of time . <|startoftext|> She has n't really ever mentioned anything about her job , I get that I work in retail but most of my friends do n't work retail . I 'm not sure why I did n't find out about her job immediately after graduation but as far as I could tell she had to go through a long and bumpy road that required a lot of help . <newline> <newline> We 've been dating for about 6 years , I can tell that our relationship is pretty simple but I ca n't give up on my girlfriend and I have more things in common than I can imagine . I do n't miss the way she holds me , but I don ’ t really know what I look like like outside of that sweet spot I ’ m talking about . She gets really close to me when we talk and the way the way she moves when we talk makes me feel something like I 'm floating on water . <newline> <newline> There 's almost always the same guy who always shows up at my work . Maybe I have an idea of what I want with him but if I had more money I would give him something more unusual than this guy . There used to be a little relationship where he came in to make sure there was enough food and was always nice about eating me . He has gotten very good at making me feel like an animal though . It almost goes against my mind every day to think about something so silly that I would say , “ Hey what your going to do today ? ” <newline> <newline> I do n't know that he is being honest but it 's like he is telling me that I is the devil or something . Like I can hear all the things he wants in me . He is always thinking ahead of he wants to be right . He makes me say some of the things that would make a man proud if he told it ’ s okay for me to say . It does give me a lot of trouble though . <newline> <newline> Even when he is good at something he is n't always right about everything . I always tell him that I am n't perfect . I have made mistakes and there has been times when I have even made choices in life that I do n't deserve . I wish that he would stop doing that as I know I would eventually . <newline> <newline> At first we used to joke about our mistakes but as time went on I realized that there was more to this than my mistakes and the mistakes I had made . I mean , I am sure that my girlfriend was doing everything right when she made it to this job so I just wanted a bit more clarity on all the times and choices she must has made . I would have loved to be a super model , but there are times where you really do need people like myself to help you make the right decisions . <newline> <newline> When I told my girlfriend I would be doing a short film soon
