 ban. <newline> <newline> The door slammed and a small, man in a white mask was in the process of making a mental note to leave. "Why did you choose to enter?" asked his friend. <newline> <newline> "Well, it's because you've got ta help the world". He spoke with an accent of the Russian language he was fluent in, "You know, we're trying to kill each other." <newline> <newline> "I am." <newline> <newline> "We know you don't speak Russian" <newline> <newline> "I told you what time it is." <newline> <newline> "It's 10:30pm." <newline> <newline> "You're supposed to be here with us for the evening, why would you leave in such haste?" <newline> <newline> "I don't even know. I just want to do something nice for everyone. It's not like I'm doing it to get you out of here." <newline> <newline> "Why would they leave you to kill my wife? Why is it you're gon na try to kill my kids? Why are they going to leave you hanging as I'm sitting here with you?" <newline> <newline> "Why are you trying to kill me? I don't want to be here." <newline> <newline> "I just want to get out of here. Now take a few extra steps, this is the best way of killing me." <newline> <newline> As I opened the door and put my foot on the concrete, nothing happened. <newline> <newline> I took a deep breath as I was getting to work, "Let's leave this way". <|endoftext|>
[WP] You live in the world where people can actually vote , change and decide what they 're good for . You 're an accountant . <|startoftext|> I stared out my window, my home. The sun hung low in the sky as it danced at our feet. The sky was black as the sky outside ; the shadows of the trees that hung above us glowed like bright eyes in the night. Behind us was the street, and the cars of the street were lined with yellow flowers whose bark was a sweet reminder of how we would pass them. <newline> <newline> We walked in silence after my office was filled with so much green. It would have been beautiful, but only green could be so warm to have flowers to call your own. In my office the walls were in constant shadow. The grass around my desk became tiled, dirt was streched across the floor. <newline> <newline> I sat at my desk and watched the grey clouds, the colours of the birds, and the air grow cold. The sun hung low in the sky, it didn't matter who voted in the elections. Sometimes it was the most glorious colour of the day, one made the whole world forget who we are. Sometimes it was yellow. <newline> <newline> I don't think I knew what I was voting for, but I was happy to see that it was there. I was happy to see that no more grey, or black, or brown, or green would be chosen. It was just as a reminder that we had a special place in the world. <newline> <newline> But for now, we just waited out my day with our friends. I took one step, and then the other, and then the one. A sharp pain shot through my chest, sending a chill up my spine. I pushed myself against the oak desk and watched the colour and smell of the flowers grow darkens at my feet. <newline> <newline> A sharp pain, the end of a branch. Blood.

"In order for the country to rule peacefully, the constitution, you must be elected as the country's president. You are now a citizen, citizen, citizen, citizen. You must not have any more colour than your own but your choice, if you do you must also choose. You may be eligible, but you are not permitted to use another's colour." <newline> <newline> A bright yellow, brown, yellow leaf sprouted out of my desk. It started to turn darker as it did the days and days passed, the leaf becoming a tree now. I could not control it anymore. I tried to sit but could not. My hands clenched and I tried to sit but could not. A dark grey cloud rolled over me. I took one shaky step. Then another. And then a cloud
