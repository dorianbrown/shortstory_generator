 rubbed his hands together . His body froze , and the tears began flowing down his face . <newline> <newline> “ I want to go home… ” <newline> <newline> “ Oh God , let it… wait… I still have one. ” <newline> <newline> “ I don ’ t want food here. ” <newline> <newline> Her voice got louder and , despite her pleas , he turned away and left her . <newline> <newline> Before he had crossed the street he saw her crying as she turned away from the entrance to a house at the end of the street . <newline> <newline> He walked down the street and stepped through a doorway after her . <newline> <newline> “ Excuse me , please… ” <newline> <newline> “ What ’ s so important ? You need to leave. ” <newline> <newline> “ I just want … ” <newline> <newline> “ Excuse me , please… ” <newline> <newline> He stepped beyond her just in time to see her walking away and stepped back just in time to make it all come crashing down . He tried to smile and feel his face , but he shook his head and turned away . <newline> <newline> She took off her bag and took a step back . <newline> <newline> “ You ’ re a strange girl… well , that ’ s… that ’ s because I ’ m not you . I ’ m a lot more interesting than I am. ” <newline> <newline> She walked a long distance and looked up at him . She gave him a smile and he stepped back , trying not to look like he was missing something , but he had found that looking for things was better this time . <newline> <newline> “ I ’ m okay… ” <newline> <newline> He took pity on her , though . <newline> <newline> “ Please leave .

Please… ” <newline> <newline> She pulled the door closed behind her again and left , turning to run away again , leaving the boy behind . <newline> <newline> “ I can ’ t go home… ” <newline> <newline> “ I know . I ’ m scared… ” <newline> <newline> “ Please , I need to be scared .

Have you heard about this guy who has the ability to bring a bear to life ? He keeps telling his story through an art class or at a park. ” <newline> <newline> He stepped forward , reaching out with his hand to touch her . The bear shook and she fell back and she turned to return to him , only pausing a moment . <newline> <newline> “ I ’ m not sure you heard about him . That guy doesn ’ t really bring bears . ” <newline> <newline> He frowned , looking at her with a blank expression . She took off her hat and began to put it on . “ No .
