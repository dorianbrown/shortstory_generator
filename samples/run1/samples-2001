 pull back the curtain . <newline> <newline> My heart goes out . The only one I care about was in my life . <newline> <|endoftext|>
[WP] A soldier sits in a deserted , dusty battlefield awaiting capture . <|startoftext|> The platoon stood in silence for a time and I could understand the confusion ; not knowing anything about what actually happened next . How did things end ? Was it a trap , an ambush , a trap laid down by my father ? <newline> <newline> I watched as the commander left the small village , I could feel the weight of his soldiers . The soldiers were weak , their armor was broken by their actions . Their bodies were weak too . <newline> <newline> The commander did not say a word , let alone make any move as the platoon advanced , as he walked forward , waiting to be pulled into action . It was not a moment to speak , I was dead . He was not here any more , not in his presence . If he had wanted to leave , he could n't . <newline> <newline> He had already started talking , his eyes searching the empty land for answers . He took a deep breath . No response . Instead , the soldiers were rushing , shouting , kicking , and taunting as if no one had been able to understand him . They would be gone in an instant , it was too late to be wrong . <newline> <newline> He walked into the forest . It was the last one left alive before he died . All of us had to pass through the valley , then follow him to the town , where we would be stopped by the soldier . He stopped just enough to look at the squad , then stopped once he reached one of the towns . <newline> <newline> I was the last , one of the soldiers had not seen a single human in his travels , all of us were killed in combat . He had to die by death , I had to die by death . I 've lost count of the soldiers I have killed from , but they have been here for generations , we have lost one more , only this one saved me too . <|endoftext|>
[WP] a child of the underworld discovers they are one species in the pantheon . <|startoftext|> The first time I saw him , I did n't know what to believe . He was a strange man of great stature but a little too tall for his stature and he was n't a good person . He seemed out of place . He was a man of power and wealth but never looked like himself in the eyes . His eyes were green and his hair was short but the only things he was shown were long flowing black hair that seemed to flow around his face as he walked . <newline> <newline> He was dressed in the most casual , flowing black leather and he had a high neckline and he was holding a small wooden cane from one of his hands . He had been looking at some of my photos online and this might appear to be in some weird way but I did n't know what they were , he was clearly some kind of `` necromancer '' but I was n't aware of his being a necromancer and so he was not showing any kind of skill . I tried to find a place in him for his presence , but it was a lonely place . He had come by to pick up some bread from his bread cart . His coat was covered with strange clothes and I was confused but I knew it was his coat . His arms were covered in strange green and purple weapons , a sword in one hand and a cross in the other . The cross was covered in a white , yellow and blue fabric and he was holding one of his weapons which seemed to be in a different color . He looked at me , looked at my face , stared at my arms and then threw himself at me . I panicked , he threw my arms and tried to throw me to the ground . <newline> <newline> It was almost as though he was about to throw me in front of him , but he could just barely cover up his mistake . He was shaking violently and then threw his arms and legs at me again . The last thing he did was he went into my face , my eyes looking at me , I did n't see anything . <newline> <newline> When the last thing I saw was his face he walked towards me , was he crying ? He looked scared but he was smiling . He smiled and said he 's sorry , it 's OK . I was so sorry I did n't know what had happened . I do n't know if it was a dream , it 's okay . He was not crying that night . He was a normal guy . <|endoftext|>
