 . I ca n't speak , and neither can you , and I did n't want to hear it . <newline> <newline> I can hear this song in your life . I will hear it when I tell you about love , hope , and life . I will hear this song as I will tell you about pain , and the tears that will forever fall so you may never see . I will hear it as I will tell you about loss , and how we can hide from ourselves . I can hear this song in your heart , and it will tell you how we need to talk things through to be happy . I will hear this song of my sorrow , and tell you to be brave . I hear this song as I tell you my good things and how I am sorry for your sadness . I hear this song in your heart . And I will tell you these words this song was written to give to you so that you would n't feel lonely . <newline> <newline> If you listen to the song , I would remind you of my words above all . I never wanted to tell you that I love you , or that I love you . But I did n't want to either . You were more than what I had given to you . You grew , and you learned . Every moment I have said these words that you loved and taught me , I wanted to give you the same . You have never known misery I have , and you never had the opportunity to learn about it . I wish that you knew how to make peace with our troubles , but I could n't tell you . I wanted to say the words you needed to hear . I wanted to tell you that it was enough . But I was too afraid . <newline> <newline> Now I feel a little different . I can say my name no more , and it will be just a name we have shared . It will be what it always has been , I want to tell you that this was the way it was supposed to be . <newline> <newline> *Says one of the doctors* <newline> <newline> <newline> *In front of thousands of loving families . <newline> <newline> <newline> *First time writing for two years . <newline> <newline> <newline> *Thanks for reading , <newline> <newline> <newline> I am happy for our success at First Novels Challenge # 36 : Poetry <|endoftext|>
[WP] `` To save the world , we must take it in our own heat '' . You are a thermometer who have just burnt themselves out . <|startoftext|> For all their stories and propaganda , they were liars . <newline> <newline> The heat could be found everywhere , in the deserts , the polar ice caps , even in an uninhabited planet , with its own native thermophores ; it was all a result of the humans forges that had existed for generations . <newline> <newline> They had grown tired of their constant wars and greed in pursuit of energy . They wanted to be left alone and to not have to make sacrifices to survive . <newline> <newline> They wanted to be left alone and to have a chance to live their lives . So they started their own societies that were isolated places where people could live in their own little communities . There was no need for the heat . <newline> <newline> Life was simple . There was no hunger , and there was no need for waste . It had been a few years for everyone there , and the heat was slowly but certainly disappearing for the first time since everyone had gone through it . <newline> <newline> But there were a few survivors . For centuries they had inhabited these lands , as an isolated cultures to be sure ; and so few had gone to them . Not many had any idea that there were others , who shared their lifestyle , that they had some form of a life . <newline> <newline> But they thrived on life , and so they would take upon the heat as a form of entertainment . <newline> <newline> But a few had managed to keep warm , much like the ones who had managed to live their own lives . They knew that there was some comfort in the heat . <newline> <newline> But it was always just enough , even with their meager energy , to prevent them from freezing to death . <newline> <newline> That was where they found the humans .

Why would there be any warmth here ? It must be the heat which had kept them in this place , where the atmosphere was so thick , the food would never provide , no one
