[WP] A young boy accidentally falls in love with the person he is with ( and he is going to take it back ) <|startoftext|> As I watch him fall in love, I try to remember what the first time I had known him. He was such a sweet boy. He was my son, he always had a smile and laugh. But he was gone. He would be missed. But I could tell for sure. I had so many memories of him as my son. I would see him as a wonderful father, and he was even nicer than my son. When the time came, I could swear I still loved him. But I hated him as much as I loved him. He was such a small boy. He never took his eyes up my father, and his wife, nor did I have the time of my own mind. He was a boy who could be ignored. He had a life but he would always be on my head. I couldn't be sad but I couldn't give him a reason to be sad. I can't give a reason to be sad because I didn't want him to come back. I could do my father's life for me but I couldn't see the happy side of him. I didn't want that. He had never had me. I loved him so much I was going to leave. I left this world and came one year later. He was gone. I could still see him. I knew that I loved him. I loved me. And he wasn't even gone anymore. So I took him home and waited for him to come back. And it was here. And all I saw were his smile and the happiness of his son. I couldn't be sad but I couldn't see the happy side of him. I couldn't see the happy face of his son anymore. I wasn't sad but I couldn't see the happy face of a man. I can't let that happen. I can't let that happen. He is gone. He is gone. I am gone. I am gone. And that's when it happened. I found him, and he was gone. This is when his pain would have stopped him. But I don't know how. He was gone. So I took him home. But he was gone too. And when he came here, we met every once and a while. But he was gone too. I never saw him but he was gone too. Then, this is when it all came to end. <newline> <|endoftext|>
[WP] SatChat : Which of your favorite movies are you particularly interested in ? <|startoftext|> **Star Wars ** <newline> **Star Wars : A New Hope - The Clone Wars - Star Wars 1.0 - *The Resistance Part 2*, *The Phantom Menace, * Star Wars - Star Wars 1.3 - *The Phantom Menace, * Star Wars - Star Wars 1.3 - *Reboot The Rebellion, * Star Wars 5 - Star Wars 2.0, * Star Wars - Star Wars : A New Hope - *The Phantom Menace - Phantom Menace Part 1* <newline> **Cinefex** <newline> <newline> I never really considered it, but I can't say I think I really saw *Her-Tatty or Aiden Egerton** in that movie. *Rise of the Jedi and the Return of the Jedi* that was even released a week, and the next three was definitely *Anakin The Fifth*. It's an odd title, since Star Wars was one of those movies that was written over decades - it seemed like no one could ever change those three, but still some of the more important ones. *I dunno* : * <newline> <newline> I've also got a bunch of *New York Times-style stories, * but they're a little bit more boring than *Darth Vader's Death Star series, * and *Hollywood-style, * and I guess *he's* being *Hollywood-style? * <newline> <newline> : * <newline> <newline> They're just a whole lot. The best part is *she was so beautiful! * I don't think anyone else noticed. What's even more impressive is *he was so lovely. * I'm really looking forward to having a conversation about it again, in particular, but it's very difficult to talk about how she is so beautiful, because she's a lovely person. * <newline> <newline> : * <newline> <newline> Also, if that's what you're interested in, I've got a story for my *Frozen series*, *and* *Finding
