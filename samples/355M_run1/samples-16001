 joked . But I did n't care . I was already in my car and I was already on my way . <newline> <newline> The first time I saw a woman on the street , I was nervous , and angry . He was obviously familiar to me . I knew it was him . I even recognized the first part of his voice . My father has been a professional boxer since he was 8. <newline> <newline> `` What if ... '' I whispered to myself . `` What if we do n't have this ? '' <newline> <newline> It was late at night when I got the call . My parents were there . `` I 'm sorry '' I said , `` I 'll be home early . '' <newline> <newline> As I walked home from school , I noticed that our headlights were n't lit . And I noticed that my back was still black . I did n't want to be paranoid . <newline> <newline> I got onto my bike and we started the journey home . When my parents arrived , they were as nervous as I was . I felt that strange feeling I have never been able to describe before . I have never been someone who was n't nervous before . The first time I was nervous was when my dad found out that my mother did n't bring me home before the last exam and did n't want to get an STD test or get pregnant ( at least not until I was 8 ) . I was a little too nervous when that happened . I was n't worried that my teacher would n't know . <newline> <newline> We turned the first corner to my home . There were no light coming on , just the cold night air . `` What 's the matter ? '' I said to no one . I could tell this was n't what I was expecting . As I slowly made my way home , I could n't help but notice what was going on . It was cold ... <newline> <newline> There was a faint light coming from a room behind one of the windows . That should have been my bedroom ... but I was at work . I was driving my car . I was driving home from my girlfriend 's house . I was in the car ... <newline> <newline> I could n't help it ... the sensation growing in my stomach ... it was so familiar . I remember feeling the same way when my father died . But that was all different from ... this . It was n't his body being pulled off a cliff . <newline> <newline> I saw my car headlights in front of me a couple of blocks away . I 'll be home early . I thought , I 'll just wait until I hear from my husband by the house ... . <newline> <newline> As I turned to the corner of my garage , I saw my car headlights . It was just a car . A black car . But the hood was covered in ... something . Something warm . I pulled down the hood of the car and looked around there . It was a cold winter night in Winterhaven , North Carolina . The snow was falling softly all around . <newline> <newline> I pulled into my driveway and was about to go to work when I noticed the lights on . I was driving home . I was n't driving home right off to work , I was driving home to the apartment , home of my girlfriend . <newline> <newline> What was going on ? <|endoftext|>
[WP] Everyone is born with a number on their wrist . They grow up with it and must provide tribute for others to have theirs . You 've found your number and it does n't seem to work in any way . <|startoftext|> I stared out into the courtyard to a man standing a few meters away from me with a strange face , but was still a boy . The look in the man 's eyes made me feel sick to my stomach that it was almost like knowing him . <newline> <newline> I looked down to the number on my wrist , 3 . I wanted to know what number it was , but it would n't do me any good . This is not a life , this is a death . I guess I was n't really sure what life I was supposed to have , but I thought I was doing quite a good job of my numbers so I decided to take this opportunity to take a gamble . <newline> <newline> `` So you 're the guy , huh ? '' His eyebrows raised in confusion as I smiled . <newline> <newline> `` What do you think it is ? The number of everyone . It 's not really important . But I do want to know . '' <newline> <newline> `` I do n't care who you are . I do want you to remember me . Everyone I 've known is a
