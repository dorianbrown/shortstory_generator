 torn to my chest , I hear a loud bang in the distance and hear a small man screaming something about, `` *GOD DAMN IT ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... '' I try to tell myself not to laugh , but I ca n't stop , it 's starting to sink in . This is going to be a big one ... <|endoftext|>
[WP] You are a detective assigned to go on `` some '' and `` let '' a crime be committed . It is done . <|startoftext|> I felt my hands on the keys as I unlocked my car . I drove to work in a blur of cars , lights . The light 's red hue made me squint but the shadows of the city made it difficult to see my feet . The lights were a blur to my eyes and my ears as I approached the police station . I opened my book to look at the news paper . <newline> <newline> `` A man has been caught shooting a police officer '' . How the hell was that not on the news . As I walked from where I parked I checked the mirror I was in , I could n't quite see my legs , how the fuck was I supposed to have walked out of it 's reflection . I did n't even want to look at my wife . She had told me she would take the day off at the next of them . <newline> <newline> As I stood in front of the officer I realized what my responsibility was . The news reported a man was shot down he was on his way to work . He was going to be arrested for a murder case where the suspect was a 15 year old girl and it took my breath away '' . I could n't help but smile . I walked over to my chair and took a breath . I could n't bear to let my wife know of this new discovery . <newline> <newline> I looked at her and gave her the light '' . I stared at my watch . <newline> <newline> 8:42:14 pm . <|endoftext|>

You come across Death in the building and ask it to show up <|startoftext|> He sat in his office , staring at some paperwork . `` Hey , where do you think you 'll be this time ? '' Someone called out . `` I dont know , can you move me back to my apartment , where I 'll never have to worry you again ? '' <newline> <newline> Death walked over and sat down near me . `` You 're not going to say a word to me , just sit in your office and let me pick you up from there . '' <newline> <newline> I walked over , my coat in my hand . `` I promise I wo n't say a word if you come back here ! '' <newline> <newline> `` Really ? '' Death asked . `` I do n't want to see you again . '' <newline> <newline> `` You know I do n't want to see you , but its a very important meeting tomorrow . '' <newline> <newline> `` I know . If you want to tell me how to do my job . '' I said , and stood up . `` Maybe tomorrow ? '' <newline> <newline> Death nodded , and I said `` Thanks for the advice man . '' <newline> <newline> `` Yeah ! '' I grabbed the phone and call him . <newline> <newline> I walk over to his office . <|endoftext|>
[WP] The narrator of a story should give the reader a sense for the character and the story . The reader should be able to guess the setting and the protagonists plans from the reader 's behavior . <|startoftext|> This morning I woke up to my lovely but lonely life ; that is , I was n't a living or dead person . I 'd been on death row for a bit , in fact , until she was discovered . She had all the doctors and nurses behind me , and I saw a few more before my wife was discovered . I was n't sure what to do . <newline> <newline> I grabbed a quick coffee . I had n't been around long because of my dementia , but it was just something to do now and then .

To be honest , I probably would have done it already had I napped it off . I think there is a story I could write for that ,
