 the `` Best Luck 's , by Michael C. Brown . I 've been looking for this . I ca n't wait to start ! <newline> <newline> *I 'll try and get you a new copy tonight . And bring the book , the book to the office , or write a thank you essay . * <newline> <|endoftext|>
[WP] You die the day following a death . Your heart breaks , only to be revived in the next instant . You never think why but to yourself , `` Maybe not '' , `` That 's how it should be '' and you think `` Well then let 's try to think something else . '' <|startoftext|> 'I got ta stay here till a guy comes to get me . My name ain't no- I live alone . '' He said slowly walking towards the apartment I was in . He was staring at the sink . “ I 've got ta stay here till a guy comes to get me. ' ” I was terrified about him being a monster . I think I might have heard his voice in the back of my mind . He said , “ You need not worry . ” I do n't understand what he 've told me . So I walked towards him and stared at him for a long time before finally realizing that he was not even real . “ I got ta stay here till a guy comes for me. ” ” I was scared of him not killing me , but rather that I was living alone , and that his words were actually real . His words only reinforced me . I did my best to protect him , but everything else was going to fail and I was going to die . ” I never thought I 'd have a chance. ” <|endoftext|>
[WP] You hear footsteps and there 's a knock on the door , someone knocks it off . <|startoftext|> `` Mr . Siegelley I 've got ta say , you know that day 's been the best . I just wonder if maybe he 'll be coming back next month . '' <newline> <newline> `` The way he looks , his hair and his nose , I know he 's done what he needs to do to make his story a hit ? '' <newline> <newline> `` No . I mean he looks like we 're done working on something , is he done making up anything ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Well , he seems like he 's gone out of his way to make a living out of it . It just seemed like he was just a nice guy . You know , he 's been like this for a while , but this one guy just sounds like a normal guy . I mean it all gets ridiculous after you try and explain to him that he 's not really in the picture . He 'll always be like this . He 's just weird , but you know how to keep cool with something like that . '' <newline> <newline> `` I 've done what I need to . I do n't know if he just wants to see my face in the media , or if that is the only way I know to stay sane . Or , he 's just just an asshole , a bunch of jerks who do n't know how to get up , and tell me I do n't care . I just want to have fun , and not be bullied at the hands of people who do n't understand . '' <newline> <newline> With a nod from the door “ How could it have been so different when I did n't know I wanted to stay ? ” <|endoftext|>
[WP] You have just become the next President of the United States . After defeating ISIS , you wake up to find out that your body has been found , only to find out that your head is actually human-sized . <|startoftext|> I was standing in the street staring at the police , my face turned to snow from my face . <newline> <newline> I turned the corner to get into my car , the door creaked open and a black male entered me . I had n't seen his face before , and he looked almost like someone who did n't know me . I started shouting to the officer who answered no , saying that if I ever want to speak again , I 'll use the excuse that he had the body of a teenage girl . After a while it dawned on me : This is not a joke , this is a killer . That is what I wanted to hear , and he just walked over . <newline> <newline> I sat down in my car and let out an uneasy and silent groan : `` Is this a joke ? '' <newline> <newline> I looked up at the white man at my shoulder . `` Hello
