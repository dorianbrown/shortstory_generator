It 'll be years before I can be sure . <|endoftext|>

'' <newline> <newline> `` Do n't worry . I 'll take care of it '' <newline> <newline> `` ... Oh '' There 's nothing but silence as a blur . <newline> <newline> I could feel the sweat run up my neck . <newline> `` Do n't worry , I 'll get out of here . '' I do n't feel anything but the wind . The water is cold ; I did n't feel thirsty . `` There is more to it than just this '' `` I 'll be okay . Just keep in mind the beauty of this place .
