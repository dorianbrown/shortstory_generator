> <newline> And now I will have to deal with the death of our savior . I will be the hero of our kingdom , but I will also need blood , a demon who will kill us all to the will of this god . What a waste . Now go and see your king ! <|endoftext|>
[WP] You 're given the choice to live a normal life or die . You choose the former . <|startoftext|> `` Hey , howdy sweetie ! '' <newline> <newline> The girl behind the counter was already fiddling with her phone . <newline> <newline> `` Oh hi my name 's Emily . '' <newline> <newline> `` Emily Baker '' <newline> <newline> `` A-hello '' she said , her voice cracking . <newline> <newline> `` Hey , it seems you 've been waiting in line , have a nice day . '' <newline> <newline> `` No , no , wait , I was ... ah , you know . You do n't really know how to treat one of my customers . They were always the worst . If they knew I was n't here for them I 'd be an absolute wreck. `` <newline> <newline> `` You know I never do anything . '' <newline> <newline> `` Then I 'll just come see you tomorrow , alright ? '' <newline> <newline> But , Emily Baker was lying . She was n't even real . There was no way in hell that was possible . <newline> <newline> `` Oh yeah , yeah , you 're coming out of line . '' <newline> <newline> The next thing she knew she was gone and she was running around aimlessly . She glanced at the door in the office and noticed another sign posted outside the coffee shop . And a strange symbol on it , probably the shape of a `` I 'm Dead '' sign . She decided to use that as a marker . <newline> <newline> She entered into the shop and began shopping . <newline> <newline> A man approached from behind the counter . <newline> <newline> `` Oh , I know you 're there , now just tell me '' He asked <newline> <newline> `` Yeah , I 'm here to help '' <newline> <newline> `` Oh and now your dead buddy has gotten a tattoo that can be found on him . Well , it 's kinda creepy that I do n't see people with tattoos on their legs and arms too . '' <newline> <newline> `` Hey , can I help you here ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Yeah sure , no problem '' <newline> <newline> The man began walking towards her . <newline> <newline> `` Can I get some milk ? '' She asked ? <newline> <newline> `` What the hell are going on ? ! ? '' He called out . She did n't reply , her heart was in her head and she knew she should n't have let a girl in this business . <newline> <newline> `` I 'm not going to sell anything on you , do you understand ? '' He asked in a stern voice . <newline> <newline> `` Yeah , that 's what I mean . You 're going to pay for the tattoo . '' <newline> <newline> `` Right . Thank you . I 'm here for your tattoo . '' <newline> <newline> The man ran away and Emily was crying , but she had her purse in her hand . <newline> <newline> `` Well , I 'm sure if we could both pay for what they did , you 'd probably be the richest man in the world . '' <newline> <newline> Emily had no intention on having money . <|endoftext|>
[WP] You live in a world where people explode when dying . <|startoftext|> The glass windows of the office were shattered , and the man 's hair and clothes were in flames . The fire illuminated the glass window at the end of his driveway . He stepped out of the office , and ran down the stairs to call an ambulance . He ran down 3 flights of stairs , and was the only one that did n't have a broken nose or a broken leg . <newline> <newline> The fire started to lighten , as it was becoming the only thing in his neighborhood . It had a very strange aura to it , which led to his death almost every time it was lit up .
