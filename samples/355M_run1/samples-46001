[WP] An archaeologist goes to a dig site to investigate some mysterious phenomenon . He finds a human skull embedded in the soil and a piece of letterhead with a note written on it . <|startoftext|> He stepped carefully next to the pit to the mound of dirt and brush that was the site of one of the biggest discoveries in decades . The skull was wrapped up very neatly , but with a very curious look to it it looked as if it had been wrapped in paper . The letterhead was written in the classic Latin script , it read as follows : <newline> <newline> `` This is John the Prophet of Bel-Air , the Lord of the Earth . We need your help . Please , take this letter as a token of faith in me and in those who follow me as my messenger . Please , let me help . I may not be religious , but I believe the Bible . '' <newline> <newline> With an even deeper voice he spoke these words . And with this he began to read : <newline> <newline> `` I know of this . We will give you what we need , but first you must give us our word on this matter . Yes I know of the world around us you will be helping . You will be able to walk among it , see those who are like you , and what not . '' <newline> <newline> He then turned to the young archaeologist and smiled , for the most part it was very encouraging . <newline> <newline> `` So John would you kindly take this to be the last word from me ? '' He spoke with such a serious look , his demeanor almost made the young archaeologist 's stomach churned . <newline> <newline> `` I do n't know , but I will , '' The young archaeologist said hesitantly , he had a slight hint of trepidation in how he 'd said this , but before he turned to go he felt some excitement start to creep in . He could n't help but feel that excitement . <newline> <newline> All but the young archaeologist knew this was a serious discovery and would be used for the future of human history . After reading the entire scripture he 'd read the following words `` I know of this . We will give you what we need , but first you must give us our word on this matter . Yes I know of the world around us you will be helping . You will be able to walk among it , see those who are like you , and what not . '' <newline> <newline> `` John are you saying we will give our word on this matter ? '' He could n't help but feel that his voice might not sound very confident . <newline> <newline> `` I do n't know John . '' <newline> <newline> He was not a religious man , and the excitement in his voice was overwhelming . He could feel himself getting nervous but remained calm for moments to remain calm he was the only one on the planet with an actual gift for such of interest to the ancient world . <newline> <
