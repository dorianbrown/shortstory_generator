[WP] Earth has been annihilated at the hands of aliens . Except they 're not a human . Instead they look like a spider . <|startoftext|> “ We know aliens will come when our sun is out. We see them as predators and their children as lovers. Our parents are as cruel as those whose flesh has been cooked at the oven. That which we made for ourselves is theirs. We know that. ” <newline> <newline> The scientist's wife came in and sat, and there, in that strange yellow suit, was the professor : <newline> <newline> “ Professor, our ship looks very different from yours, as if your skin is being painted to look almost human. Our body and brain are so similar. Our species can still be understood. Our whole lives are intertwined. Our world is not the same as it once was. We live, and we play, and we eat. <newline> <newline> We learn how to survive, and to survive our own. And we are still our children. <newline> <newline> ***" Scientists from Mars, Earth and all of the nearby planets are ready for our arrival. It was a long journey, but the human race will wait. The alien species ’ evolution began. ” *** <newline> <newline> The professor stared at her husband, who looked down at his face. <newline> <newline> “ What will they do this time? ” <newline> <newline> “ They will kill off our planet, and we will die in a small fire of death and rot. Our race will no longer be alive. They will be our children. Our home. That is what we must all be ready for. ” <newline> <newline> The doctor spoke again, but the first sentence was all she wanted to say. She looked at his face. <newline> <newline> “ I just do not have the energy to do this. I just can not do it. We need to get started. We will have to do it once more. We can not wait. Maybe, before we turn into humans, something will bring back our kind. ” <newline> <newline> The two lovers held the scientist's hand. <newline> <newline> “ We will find out, and eventually, we will remember. We will find out where all the other planets are, and we will find out how they can be destroyed. ” <newline> <newline> That was the last thought they heard before they could say goodbye. <newline> <newline> ***" Scientists from Earth and all of the distant planets are ready for our arrival. It was a long journey, but the human race will wait. The alien race must learn our survival habits in order to survive. They will learn how to survive. *** <newline> <newline> The scientist said something as his wife and wife sat beside them. <newline> <newline> “ What will they do this time? ” <|endoftext|>
[WP] `` I 'd rather be with her . '' <|startoftext|> His hand held a bouquet of roses and a large bouquet of money. The flowers on the rose were the best one that he had ever seen. His mind was racing with love, it's how he always went. But in the end he chose her : <newline> <newline> I would rather be with her. <newline> <newline> His kiss moved her hand into his heart and she moved his hand into the pocket of hers, she kept it there she looked up to him and said : "Do you love her?" <newline> <newline> He said no, he said he will never love her. She looked at him with sadness and he smiled, but he lost it, he said yes but he would not love her anymore. <newline> <newline> Then he turned away from her and walked out the door. He went and ran back to his house and he got down on that couch and said "I'll stay here with you." <newline> <newline> The next night he slept alone. He dreamed of flowers and a man who took care of the roses, and he slept that night, until about 10 PM he woke up in bed. There he wrote : <newline> <newline> "I'd rather be with her. I'm tired of her." <newline> <newline> He thought about this all night, even the time they talked or kissed. He had to write. It
