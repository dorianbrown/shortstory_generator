issen, that I've lost my mind. I should have taken the train to Paris- the first stop I ever saw it. I'd been looking for Paris, I only knew what route I was on. Well, I had been for a couple of years now and I've finally found the one. <newline> <newline> I reach and take the one that I want. <newline> <newline> There is a light on my back and I walk to the train station as I pass for the last time. <newline> <newline> It is dark, but the light is blinding. <newline> <newline> I think I have never been so tired before- maybe I just lost my mind. <newline> <|endoftext|>
[WP] An alternate universe in which a group of gamers is the World 's largest FPS <|startoftext|> "Alright, guys, put on your helmets and come here," the player yells at Marko. The team heads look at him, and the player goes in their direction, "I don't want to die." Then, the player jumps up on top of the chair, and they jump and, and the guy in front of them drops with a thud to the ground. They are all looking at each other, then everyone just looks at the guy before them. In unison, the players yell in unison. "WHAT IS GOING ON!?" and then they begin to run. The player shouts loudness, then they start running as fast as they can and the guy in front of them runs away. They get caught and it turns out, Marko hasn't died yet. He was supposed to be the main character, but he's already beat Marko. And now he's the main character. <|endoftext|>
[WP] As a joke , you 've invited your friend over , but they 're not here . <|startoftext|> "Come in, you silly twat," I said casually, walking into the room with the warm smile of a new born. <newline> <newline> "Don't worry, I am here," he said, his voice as gentle as a baby's. <newline> <newline> "Oooh, you look really cool," I said, kissing the top of his head slowly. "You look like this guy you've been dreaming about." <newline> <newline> "Oooooh, this guy is kinda cool, but how do you know I'm not here. Let me see..." he said, pointing to the TV in the corner of the room. "Show time." <newline> <newline> "I am here, I am here," I said, holding up my hand. <newline> <newline> He looked at me. <newline> <newline> I held up my hand. <newline> <newline> "Uhgosh, do you do that? It's easy to do, just stick your hands in the TV." <newline> <newline> He didn't answer me. He just stood there, his smile was as pale as mine, his body was frail in a way. <newline> <newline> The TV went on. He was talking about how he had gotten so close to the news and had started a subreddit, but the fact was he wasn't here. <newline> <newline> At least, I wasn't here. I'd invited him and he, well... me. <newline> <newline> "I know who you are, I know what you want," I told him, walking in. <newline> <newline> As the door behind me opened, he opened it, with a sudden, sharp jerk. I stood there, shocked. <newline> <newline> "You're here?" I finally said, and he smiled a sad smile. <newline> <newline> "I am here," he said, his expression turning sad. "I'm you." <newline> <newline> I stared, confused at first, but I soon realized I didn't understand what he didn't mean. How could we be this close. Or could this be another joke? <newline> <newline> The door to my bedroom opened, and he, dressed in a white robe, stood there, smiling, a slight, smirk. <newline> <newline> "I'm a fan of you, aren't I, kid?" <newline> <newline> "Yes, I am. And you?" <newline> <newline> He sat down, opened the door, and stood there, in front of me, behind me, staring at the wall behind me. <newline> <newline> "Do you know anyone?" <newline>
