[WP] He sat there a month . His life was n't much fun . This time , as he sat before a mirror , he saw himself in a different reflection than others in the past . <|startoftext|> He sat there a month while a man in a suit sat across him from him . The man had this look on his face . He said something about wanting to help the world , and a certain amount of money . But the man never seemed to pay him , and he was n't the last one . Many a time , a young man has wandered among his reflections to get some information about a person . Some ask too much , he just says the same things they say . Some ask too little . He was looking for the most important thing he could ever say for the people on planet Earth . So the man , after looking at him a few times , said something about the life he was leaving behind . <newline> <newline> He was leaving behind . He had some more money , he told the man , and a new job . The man was so excited , all his life he would never say anything that was important , but now he just went along with whatever the human was saying . He said hello . He said hello , again , and again . He asked a few questions , and he got so many questions . Many a time , a young man would ask him what he wanted to know . He just would n't tell them . He did n't know what he wanted , until he asked . Then they met . So the man , feeling really lonely , was going for a walk , and they walked together . They talked for a bit before they left , but no one ever called . <newline> <newline> The man was a good guy , he told him when they were alone , and he did . His family never bothered to follow on , he just told them how he felt ; that he was lonely , and he could n't let anyone in . He told the man , who was a bit surprised . He told him a story about how he had lost his family once , and that he just wanted to help find them , although he did n't know how he wanted to do it . So the man was a nice guy , he told him , and he did . <newline> <newline> But they never talked . <newline> <newline> <|endoftext|>
[ OT ] Writing Workshop # 23 : Building a Strong Female Protagonist <|startoftext|> So I do n't agree with much of them . I used to make a little bit of myself in each of my stories . It was n't really a story , but it was fun to write . <newline> <newline> It 's funny to see some people with a little bit of their own on the side . I feel writing is just a job . Do it because you need to , but do n't feel that you are better than someone else . <newline> <newline> That 's my biggest critique though - do n't take into consideration a character who would have been a nice but not a nice little fuck up . <|endoftext|>
[WP] `` Humans , we have many talents . How great they are though , is a matter of effort . '' <|startoftext|> `` Humans , we have many talents . How great they are though , is a matter of effort . '' <newline> <newline> It was a good speech , though I doubt that it will translate well . I sat the speaker down , and sat down . I had been listening to it many times , but it was really difficult to comprehend what it was saying . <newline> <newline> `` I will give you that speech you had been waiting for . How great it is , how magnificent and how true
