 anything . My own thoughts were getting increasingly diluted by the fact that it was only in my dreams and visions that I had actually made the choice that I am walking away from my wife for the last time . I could still hear her sobbing . I knew that I should be afraid of what she had done to me . But , no . She was too innocent . And , like her father , I needed to be brave for her . I needed to have faith that I would not hurt her . But that was not my choice , only the way she wanted me to be . <newline> <newline> Her face had fallen into a frown that had gone from innocence to horror just before she 'd asked for a hug that her arms could n't keep away.At the same time , I could still feel her shuddering as I closed my eyes with a sudden snap , she had n't even closed her eyes yet . The thought of letting go of me for good was like watching someone trying to escape an invisible wall as they 're desperately trying to escape death . But my arms would n't let go of me for good . And thus , my mind left the reality I 'd just seen myself walk away from her , leaving her to hold it out in what I could only assume are the last moments of her life . <newline> <newline> I knew the other would ask what I 'd done . And then , she 'd ask me exactly how I 'd tried to do anything . And that was it . That was my answer . I 'd tried to make some sort of a difference . To do anything that could have changed the world . But I 'd failed , and it was the most depressing situation of my entire life . But I 'm so sure things would get better . Hopefully . <newline> <newline> So let 's say we get together and decide to call this the `` Life Debt '' . I think I 'll do what I 've done before , try and change the world with my own life . I know this will be hard . It 's going to hurt . But if I do n't do it right , then you can bet it 'll hurt bad . <|endoftext|>

[WP] One day , everything disappears into thin air . <|startoftext|> My hand was already in my pocket . I held my breath as the cold air around me faded into air . The cold air . I took a deep breath in and took a deep breath out . Then , something touched my foot , the cold air around me faded into light . I was standing , and I held my breath . Time passed and the world faded into nothing . That â€™ s all I felt , as I looked down
