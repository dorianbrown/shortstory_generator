 anymore , if this is how this ends . <newline> <newline> `` If they 're going away , they 're going to be gone soon . '' <newline> <newline> `` Wait , '' she smiled , `` if a person is going away . '' <newline> <newline> `` You ca n't , '' I began . A small child in my way . A man in my way . It took him a long time for him to fully fall down , and soon he was only inches from my face . He was just there , and he did n't know how to run back . So I picked up my gun , and began shooting back . <newline> <newline> I was surprised . I almost did n't believe these people were in my way . If this is my first experience with shooting a person in the face , I would n't have believed it at all , that man was probably insane . But I did n't listen to any more of their yelling , not once that they yelled back that no one was going away . My gun started to fire at whatever they were . I put it on the ground , and I began to wonder , what to do next . <newline> <newline> I did n't care . <newline> I put the gun away in the nearest safe , and tried to ignore other noises at night . I ran to my car , and got out of the car . He must 've gotten in and been hit by a car , and I had to get out . My family was home , so I decided to go to the woods to investigate . As I passed the woods by the town , I noticed a strange sign , written in stone , that called out my identity . <newline> <newline> `` I am the last of this world , '' the sign read , pointing up in the sky , `` and I am going to live forever . '' <newline> <newline> I looked at my phone , and thought to myself maybe , `` *if I die* , I will live forever . '' I smiled at the thought , and then ran away , for the remainder of my lives , just like this . The last of them . <newline> <newline> I 'm sorry to everyone , that was all I could ever expect from this , and I hope they all can find each other . <newline> <newline> <|endoftext|>
[WP] Everyone is born with superpowers , but no one has experienced a power before . You are a normal 15 year old in the year 2050 . <|startoftext|> My father and mother always seemed surprised at this fact . Like they were n't going all the way to the top at the moment . As they put the two of them down I had to be careful , trying to avoid them from doing so . <newline> <newline> One man was the least likely to get all the attention it seemed . His dark complexion was barely noticeable at the beginning , and a wide brimmed hat seemed to be the only thing that kept his presence there . <newline> <newline> Everyone was quite taken aback at the fact that he was a regular at all ages , and that the youngest man he knew never had a chance against him , when he was 5 . He was the second oldest person in the country , not even the oldest man in history . His eyes remained fixed on the young man sitting in the middle of the room , waiting for his turn to speak . <newline> <newline> His voice was full of emotion . He knew the best course of action was to ask his mother something in particular . <newline> <newline> The older man , dressed in a white coat , stood beside the other man on the other side , giving a nod . A small smile crept across his face , and he gave no response . <newline> <newline> A moment later there was a knock at the door . <newline> <newline> The young man stood up and walked to the door , taking a long look into the room , and sighed . He had n't been this nervous in many years . It was a shame too , to have to be the one to start with so many great accomplishments . No one would listen to their old man about what he did . He was merely a young man with a big purpose , a true hero , something he could be proud of . <newline> <newline> In his hand he grabbed a golden ring . His dad gave him the ring of the age before , and he felt the warmth . A great sense of pride was now spreading through his veins . This was the first time that his life experience had been remembered . Not only did he become known as the man with the ring , it also happened to him and everyone else he served in all of his lives . <newline> <newline> `` I hope our
