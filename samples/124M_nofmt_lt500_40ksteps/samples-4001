[WP] `` God knows why man can not exist in other universes . '' <|startoftext|> In the beginning, the Gods came into being. The Creator, the Mother and the Father, the Maker and the Maker. Then, the Gods created and commanded the creatures to come and take everything that is and move. They created and directed them unto the final point where they were to live forever, like a dying star upon the sun. <newline> <newline> At first, their great leader believed that this was a good time to start a religion for the Universe. Many Gods were eager to meet their God as they were eager to believe in him. <newline> <newline> The next few times, Gods were eager to take anything, but soon, they learned that they could not do it. The last Time, when there were many Gods, it had been decided they would accept whatever was given to the God and take everything that was and move to other universes. So, they decided to create their God with no Gods. <newline> <newline> In that time, they changed their name to a different name, and even went to see their God. They were amazed when they saw their God who was not as smart as He was looking for them. He made them not the most clever, but the God had a bright plan. He did it by allowing the Gods to live in the Creator for another 2 years. When they came to realize that they needed more time to prepare their God, they took up an activity of their Creator and he became very angry at them. <newline> <newline> The days were the only days in which the Gods played with each other, and when they did not play at all, they did what they did best. The other Gods became very angry at the Gods. <newline> <newline> They did not see this coming, but they did not listen to their Creator's criticism. They did not know that God is angry towards them. A single day in the history of the universe in between the last and last of the Gods, God was a God who lived a life eternal, without suffering anymore. <newline> <newline> <|endoftext|>
[WP] An American soldier in Iraq is the `` Devil '' . <|startoftext|> "Do you hear? I'll be back in a minute. How long can I leave the bridge? I swear to god my dad's got ta know to put the damn guy out and go home." <newline> <newline> I was a little bit surprised to see him in a place that didn't pay any attention to me. Maybe he was just in some kind of weird, strange country, where I used to get beaten up. This guy's the one and he was the one who made the call. <newline> <newline> * <|endoftext|>
[WP] The Last Knight . A great war ... A world where everyone is king . This was your story to see what you 'll get when you die . <|startoftext|> There is only one God. One entity without boundaries ; nothing is a being for the last two million years of the human race. One that only exists where there exists nothing for the humans, there is only an entity. <newline> <newline> There was a time when we did not know of this because there never was in the first of our two great wars. The earth wasn't even there at the time. It was there, a few blocks over, and a few hundreds of miles away. One was lucky ; two had more than their share of surviving. This one was lucky. <newline> <newline> On a clear day we sat in the sun at a large camp, the sun rising over the horizon, the sun rising over the horizon and leaving clouds of dust behind. I watched the sun rise over the horizon as its rays brushed against the sky, as the sun set on its own back and it descended down the clouds. As its rays hit the ground I watched its last moments. We watched as the sun grew brighter, as its rays faded from view. <|endoftext|>
[WP] The world is a wasteland , with every person dead or missing from every planet as it was , there are no people left . As the last line of defense against the impending apocalypse , you arrive at the last planet you can think of and discover what has changed in your life . <|startoftext|> For years, I stood in this void. In my first few months I would spend alone, but this is when my thoughts began to focus ; I had not found a way out. There is no one to protect me from this. My world was destroyed by a plague, and I was not going to die. No
