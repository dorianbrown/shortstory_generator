 <newline> <newline> She could feel her body shaking , but she could n't move . She was about to give up and just let it go , but then something felt warm on her legs . <newline> <newline> She felt another feeling as she looked down the small hallway and saw a small blue box in her hand . She had tried to open the box , yet could only close the door as her hand gripped it tightly . It seemed to be held tight . So close . <newline> <newline> *What the heck is that ! ? * She panicked , but she did n't want to leave yet . Her head slowly turned and she heard her eyes widen in surprise , as she could n't move . She knew at long last . She heard her own voice , but it did n't matter . <newline> <newline> She looked around as she quickly ran to the front door . It 's strange feeling to feel something warm , as if it 's a small hand grasped you , but not a small hand reaching it 's own in a small way . She could feel her body move as she ran around her house . It was warm but not hot , like it was warm now at the end of the day . <newline> <newline> She heard footsteps , but she heard her own voice . It was like an echo , but she felt her voice again , `` What is that ? ? '' <newline> <newline> The voice seemed to resonate with her as she saw the little box in the front of the house . It was all there . A small blue , but not black box . <newline> <newline> After the little box , she looked inside , it was a new box already . It was the same old box . It was empty . It had not been opened yet . No one ever opened anything . She did n't need to . She was still alive . She was n't sick . <newline> <newline> She looked around , but the voice did n't matter . Even if she had something to live for , she knew it could never come to an end . A new face she did n't feel in years was her own again . <|endoftext|>
[WP] All babies in North America are genetically enhanced so that they will be the center of life . Every two to three years a new type of infant is born . <|startoftext|> I could n't feel much , I could n't move very well . I had no legs or arms or arms or heads or anything . But I could feel all those things , all those people , standing there , watching my little baby . Watching , waiting for the day , and just before it . <newline> <newline> They said I would be the one to receive a gift from God . <newline> The ones who would make things happen . <newline> The ones who did n't make something happen . <newline> The ones who could never , should n't , or could n't make anything happen . <newline> <newline> I could barely breathe , I tried desperately to keep breathing . But the constant motion caused me to cough , and cough- <newline> <newline> I was about to get hit by a car , but paused , and the first time I saw something was different . <newline> <newline> The first time I felt them . <newline> <newline> When the child made its first breath , I saw a spark of my own . <newline> <newline> And the second time , my heart was torn free and my vision blurred . A million miles high . <newline> I was on the top , and the world was upside-down . I lost my right hand and lost my left arm and were on a table . I saw my friends , who I could n't remember , who I could n't remember . <newline> <newline> I could n't move very well . <newline> I could n't feel the little ones breath , either . <newline> <newline> And I could n't breathe . <|endoftext|>
[WP] Your family has a very special situation , but no one knows about and nobody knows about . <|startoftext|> There is something wonderful that does n't come through your door that you 'll love it most , is n't it ? A sense of happiness to the world . If you can make your own happiness . Your own happiness . It 's all connected to you . A sense of fulfillment that fills your life . The feeling you get when you let your heart rejoice in its success , and when it falters to a small smile . When it finally collapses on your mother 's arms . When the joy of your family finally reaches you . When it finally leaves you . <newline> <
