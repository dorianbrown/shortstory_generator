int - not good . The only thing that could make you think it was possible for a man to be a cat that was n't a human or a mouse or a monkey or an ape at all is a cat . He 's a cat . And I did n't even have to fight her . He was n't even the same thing as me . He was n't just a cat and a mouse or a cat and a monkey - he was a cat . And he died . And it was the cats that saved him . <newline> <newline> <|endoftext|>
[WP] You are given a life insurance policy by Death himself . A time traveler keeps you alive so he can deliver policy on a car he feels you live ( without his explicit permission ) . They keep you until the sale is complete , but the man at the wheel of the car does n't make it . <|startoftext|> There was little to no reason for me to take the money . I just did n't understand it - there was no choice that I was being forced to take the money . If it meant I would 've died then that was clear . There was no choice for me to move , for myself , but I 'd taken the money anyway because of it . <newline> <newline> There was an insurance policy . <newline> <newline> It was very simple . I 'd been given life insurance by Death himself for some time . It was very nice - the price had n't come out of nowhere and at the time I assumed it was worth the trip . For some , it was n't really worth it , and it was n't until that one evening when the insurance came in and my eyes were fixed to the roof , when I saw a man standing behind me wearing a black suit and walking into the parking lot . <newline> <newline> `` You . '' <newline> <newline> I looked back and saw the man stood behind me , a broad white beard and a slight scar . He looked like a tall , proud man that I could hardly see - but that did n't matter - for a moment . He was walking on a trail and started to slow as he walked . When the driver stopped to catch his breath and looked back up , he stopped to catch his breath and start again . <newline> <newline> This time he started slow . <newline> <newline> It took a few moments but I was pretty sure there was some sort of pause in a man whose face I could clearly see now . <newline> <newline> I did n't speak and he spoke with a raised voice , a strange tongue that sounds like it came out of a human mouth but had a similar sounding voice . The man 's voice was soft and monotone . I could see that he was not speaking at all but his voice was still there , I knew him , I could see his lips moving under the roof but he was not saying a word . He just kept walking and talking to me in that strange human sound that seemed to have come out of no machine . <newline> <newline> It was weird for a moment then , to have someone listen in in a strange way . <newline> <newline> I smiled and told him that it was fine and that he could move on , that there might be something he could do to make things right . He walked off , and then he looked back up . He looked at the car and smiled at me again . <newline> <newline> The man behind me spoke again , then he stopped and looked back at me with a serious expression on his face . The car was starting to take off . <newline> <newline> The man stopped to catch his breath and asked for my help walking toward the vehicle and starting to slow down to make sure he was getting to the car . <newline> <newline> The car stopped to catch its breath and the man looked up and took off . I looked at my feet and then back at the man and laughed . <newline> <newline> He turned and watched him go towards the car in slow motion and then he stopped and smiled again . <newline> <newline> The man looked at the car , then smiled . <newline> <newline> He was good . <newline> <newline> I smiled and told him what I was going to do . I did n't know who or what or why . It did n't make sense to me . <newline> <newline> I looked at the man and said : `` I did it , '' and I said : `` I will never have to go back to you again . You are one of the few men here who have the insurance and the insurance is how the money is supposed to come . I was there , I 'll be there . Please . Just
