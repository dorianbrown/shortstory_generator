[ EU ] Harry Dresden was born on April 31st , 2037 . His early life started as an ordinary boy but grew into adulthood and eventually became an advanced wizard . He was destined to be a professor of magic and a master of potions , but instead he became the world 's greatest wizard . <|startoftext|> I had never truly believed that I would take up the mantle of Professor , or that I would be the one who would make sure all wizards wanted peace . But my mother would keep reminding me as I grew through this hell and the world of her youth , and how great it all was to watch our friends grow up and live like this . It could be beautiful . It was . <newline> <newline> She would n't be happy about it . <newline> <newline> She did n't approve of her family , her husband , her only child , who were all dead and had all failed to inherit this house . I still could n't understand why she gave my father this house but I could not stop caring about her , she was my only one . I ca n't help but cry every now and again . <newline> <newline> She would tell me if I tried my hand at helping her . I 'd ask to marry her . I always liked her . But no . She would make sure that I would not be the one to get married . <newline> <newline> So , what happened ? I asked her what was keeping me from getting married with her . A small man she was , maybe a young , loner with none of the talents and skills she so much as could have . She replied with an awkward , `` Not the kind of person who thinks that he â€™ ll find you , or anything at all '' but she was in no mood to talk . <newline> <newline> And then I thought I heard her calling me by her last name .

But I could n't stay at the school . If I decided to go to the university , what would my professor of magic be able to do ? <newline> <newline> I left for the school in the early evening . I could sit outside in the empty houses and wait . I could just sit and wait . I was tired of this job , this isolation , of course . But it did n't stop me waiting . <newline> <newline> I was tired of waiting . <newline> <newline> I was tired of being alone . <newline> <newline> I knew I had to leave my house before I fell and found my way home . I knew I had to move out before the winter started . But I was done with making me a useless burden and did n't care anymore . <newline> <newline> If I wanted peace , I would have to leave before I passed . I was tired of waiting . I only had one life left . <newline> <newline> This is my first , but I have been working on this one for a while . <|endoftext|>
