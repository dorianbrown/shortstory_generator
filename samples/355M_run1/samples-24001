======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 It is n't even the world that they have discovered and it is n't even the world that they 've already colonised . What they have discovered , is that it 's much harder to be alone . <newline> <newline> It used to get lonely too . One by one I took one of their children , as they put it , `` for a chance to be alone with something they like . '' In the process of making those few people a little more happy it seemed a little less lonely with them in my presence . <newline> <newline> That 's how it had to be . They took one . As in . That 's what a lot of kids do nowadays , with their first day being so much longer than they had expected and taking more from me than I would like . I suppose my patience went on . It was n't long before two . I could smell their tears in my hair in the wind of the fall . It was a nice thing to have . <newline> <newline> They do have a thing for me back . The little girls and I were the ones who came across them . They had told me when I was a child and taught me everything about them and what not to use . I learned so much about them . I learned to do n't worry about them . I would n't if they told me to . <newline> <newline> Their friend had once told me , `` I do n't like you because you 're not alone . That 's why I 'm not with you . '' <newline> <newline> I did n't want to have to tell her I was lonely for she was n't the type to tell me that . I could n't have a child around her . <newline> <newline> I went away , to find out if she had told anyone else . <newline> <newline> That she had asked me . <newline> <newline> They had told me . <newline> <newline> `` What 's your name ? '' <newline> <newline> I did n't know what to say or even remember any of it . But I kept asking . <newline> <newline> `` Your name is Jack . '' <newline> <newline> She was not the girl . I did n't suppose she had been in quite as much trouble as this . <newline> <newline> `` Why do n't you want to call me Jack ? '' <newline> <newline> That 's when my parents told me I was the new child on their wedding day . They showed me their rings and I found that it was n't my father but another one . I could still hear him talking and I knew . I knew I was about to be alone forever when my parents were both found in a very different room in the room with us and we met in a very different room . I found out about my family and were told they were n't my father and my mother was too . Both of them were dead and were still trying to figure out who I was . <newline> <newline> I found all kinds of things during the days , just laying there as I waited for my parents to return . One of the bodies were badly burned . My mother was dead . There was a whole pack of bodies laying like dead flowers in my father 's coffin . <newline> <newline> But I was too afraid to tell any of the other people that I was in this room and they had already gotten up and left . I was alone forever . I did n't have to stay alone in the dark anymore . They told me I was n't sure they could find me but they were getting me as soon as they could . I told them I was too scared and I knew what they would do . <newline> <newline> They told me about how I had been found and that I would get an hour of time in the cell they had sent me to to a little later . They had called and left for the cell as I sat there waiting for them to come back and tell the rest of the town about it . They had said I was not alone after they had brought me to a small room . They told me they could use me as many times as they wanted . They did n't tell me a lot of things about each other but they would be fine . <newline> <newline> Once we were alone again we could talk about the times . The way their houses were , and if I had known they had to take me into another room . I did n't know what I wanted at first but I found out they were n't afraid if they left me alone . And they were n't afraid at all . They were very happy when I told them about the people there . They told me and that made things easier . <newline> <newline
