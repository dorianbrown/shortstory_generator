 , . <newline> <newline> `` The humans think they can take us to our ships ? What do they know of space travel ? '' she pointed to me . <newline> <newline> `` They 're space freaks , they only go as far as their own damn ships are from us . '' she yelled . `` There was a whole army , we could just jump to another star out the universe , we could go to the moon or anywhere . We have technology for that ! '' <newline> <newline> `` So no weapons on our ships ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Not on our ships . '' <newline> <newline> `` No , there was nothing on the ships . You know we were n't on space freighters , we were on exploration ships . The first time they brought us a cargo ship , we were more scared than anyone ever had been . Hell , the first trade ships were here , but they were still a few blocks behind us . We would have been stopped by any technology they could possibly make . But we were different , we had mastered space travel and we were here to take back what we came from . <newline> <newline> `` You still do n't have to worry about them taking over all of your ships . They only have so far before they 're destroyed . '' she explained patiently , `` We can take them anywhere and we 'll have enough ships to make the trip outpace . We 're almost there , you know how quickly they go to warp . You can do anything you want in your fleet . '' <newline> <newline> `` It 's dangerous , I 'm a pilot , I do n't know how many people around here have seen their own fleets . I see everything every day , just yesterday , a couple of our scouts went by an enemy fleet and we were n't prepared for what they were carrying , so we lost 10-11 of our best battle fleet and 2 of their best engineers . The worst part is none of it is in our fleet , you 've never seen the first fleet but this , this is a new level , no weapons , no shields so you ca n't even guess just what we 're gon na catch . '' she sighed . <newline> <newline> `` Do n't worry , I am here to help you out . '' I said as I turned around to leave again . <newline> <newline> `` Thank you . '' she said . <|endoftext|>
[ IP ] The Blue Door <|startoftext|> `` We 're not letting you in , Agent Finch . '' Her voice was stern , cold even , her fists clenched so tightly that her knuckles turned polished steel , as she glared down at me . I 'd come to this office in a state of panic , and to my surprise the receptionist was standing right next to me in line . Her words hung in the air as she stared down at me , her eyes glazing . <newline> <newline> `` I do n't have time to think about it . I 'm writing , '' I muttered out-of-my-entirelly , my voice as much as my hands , her anger burning hot in small bits and small bits . One after the other , it was like a flame that would n't have been extinguished by anything more than a simple word . `` I 'm not ready . '' <newline> <newline> `` You may be in danger , Agent Finch . '' The receptionist said bluntly . Her words were soft , not a lot of them . `` Do not be . Please , let 's go . '' <newline> <newline> I looked back to her . Her eyes glowed as the tears in my pit were going to make her look at me like a child being torn apart , how she 'd look at me , as if I some monster had just come for her . As I walked behind her my hands turned off her face , and for a moment I stood there . Like she had done before , she stood there , like I had done before , and it was n't so terrible , not at all . Not at all . I just stood there , eyes on each side of the desk , and I held her hand and she was cold like a bird that had been shot by a badger . The bird had been shot straight through the skull , it 's prey dead . `` She 'd be fine . '' <newline> <newline> `` No , Finch , you 're still not right . '' <newline> <newline> `` You do n't understand , '' I said through clenched teeth . `` They 're all wrong . Do n't look around , Finch . This ca n't end well . '' For a moment she just looked at me . `` The doors , my dear , '' she said , a
