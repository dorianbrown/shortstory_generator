 I want to kill her , I want to kill myself. ” He said . <newline> She smiled and tried to hide herself . He took a swig and asked her if she wanted to kill me . <newline> “ No . For now , you must kill me. ” <newline> He was surprised . There was no way her words could convey everything . He was supposed to do it . There was nothing he could do to have done about it . But she was always a better person than he was . She needed me . And she took it . <newline> I knew I was never meant to die . But there 's a way . He did n't give a shit . He just said something , and then she died , and he died . <newline> <newline> “ If you kill me , I will be the one to get rid of the human race. ” <newline> <newline> She was so beautiful that he was just jealous . He had n't given a shit about humanity . She would only hate me . Because I killed her . <newline> “ But I do n't care . ” <newline> <newline> He put another swig into his drink . <newline> “ I know what you 're thinking . I can talk . I can make you feel better . I might even find I love you. ” <newline> <newline> “ You could not love me. ” I heard her say . And I wanted to talk . <newline> <newline> “ No . No you 're not . <newline> And neither of you had left me . <newline> <newline> And yet I do care . <newline> And you would kill me , too . ” <newline> <newline> “ I am sorry . I should not have been killed . I am sorry that you killed me. ” <newline> <newline> He nodded . “ I knew everything , and you knew everything . I just made you kill me. ” <|endoftext|>
[WP] You 've been at the hospital with your doctor for months , and you 've been diagnosed with cancer . Your doctor tells you that he 's told you have cancer . <|startoftext|> `` Are you a freak ? There 's no way to explain that there 's no way to explain this feeling , do you even feel this ? '' I ask her while sitting in my living room , holding up an old medical record and a mug . I was n't even sure if I wanted to or not . <newline> <newline> `` You were in hospital for months , after all . You feel like you 're going to die or something in the days to come , so it 's my idea that I do this . You 're an old man , and I 've seen this in your eyes , but I 'd be lying . It 's my idea that I do this , you can explain my body like this . It 's the worst-case scenario here , I guess , unless ... '' I stutter , my voice trembling . I had never felt this bad before , it was hard to explain , I mean , I ca n't even give a shit . <newline> <newline> `` Do n't talk nonsense , this is a real thing . '' She says while holding a clipboard , I find her mouth opening up again , smiling again , `` So , it 's just a thing about you or what you do . '' <newline> <newline> `` The doctor is trying to explain it to me . This means my body is dead , which I 'm not sure how it works- '' I ca n't put the words right , she makes a fist , `` He 's doing this on purpose , because my body may have been taken from me . It 's a sort of self loathing , because it affects the way I treat people who are going to die or be taken away like me or whoever was stealing my money , '' She grabs a pen and starts talking , `` Why are your eyes getting more and more red ? There are people in there who have cancer , I do n't think it was natural . '' <newline> <newline> I could n't get more than a few tears in my eyes , but I was sure she knew that . She knew the reason why he 'd told me that . <newline> <newline> `` Because I 've had cancer . '' She says while talking , `` Cancer is like any other way to get rid of that person . You have an itch , and you have an itch- '' I could n't feel her eyes , but the itch was there , she was glowing with the ability to control the itch and control the pain . <
