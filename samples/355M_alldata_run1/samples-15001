 hardest of my life . As the years have passed , her memory of the day is fading . As she gets older , I remember them like a memory . And that 's how I know it 's time . <newline> <newline> I know I 'm not ready . <newline> <newline> `` I wo n't need to worry about it , my wife and I are going to be married in two hours '' , my voice is quivering . <newline> <newline> I smile as I stand up . I 'm looking out over the bridge , not quite there , but I do n't want to be there . I want to know if a car will arrive soon . If I will be able to move . If a dog will arrive at the gates I think I will ask myself some more questions . But first I have to get to the plane . And I 'll take that plane tomorrow . <|endoftext|>

[WP] You discover a massive machine is controlling the lives of millions of people through a video feed . The reason for this is not explained to you . <|startoftext|> The news had reached everyone around the country and the world . Most of the footage was from the cameras , some on top of their shoulders and some on the shoulder of their mother ; a man on top of his mother , who had their heads down but their eyes fixed onto the television . She watched silently , and never spoke . <newline> <newline> There was more , however ; the man on top of his father , who stared solemnly towards the screen . In his hand was a note - the same that he had found when he found himself under the influence of a substance once upon a time . `` We shall see your friends again '' it said . <newline> <newline> There was silence . Then the man came , on his knees , looking as if he could n't believe it . `` Why are n't we all okay , huh ?

'' <newline> <newline> `` You mean you 're not here ? '' <newline> <new
