 towards the city they live in . My friends were gone , but I had them . <newline> <newline> I could n't go to the city because no one wanted to be there , or else I 'd feel the shame of the crime . But we could n't go any further ... <|endoftext|>
[WP] `` All the great evils await below , waiting for you if you dare . '' <|startoftext|> The two stood still in silence , arms tied , their faces like stone . The sun was setting , the wind had rustled a few pines . Yet both men remained perfectly still , head locked , gaze locked with the one on the mountain . A small fire surrounded them , thick smoke that wreathed smoke from their fists . <newline> <newline> The other one pushed the gun out of his back , it clattered on the ground . Its trigger was not a good one , the bullet had missed a vital spot and had not been cleanly fired . <newline> <newline> `` Why do n't you run this way , you bastard . It never worked for you before . '' <newline> <newline> The other man stared at the man in front of him . He could not be too busy , so he pushed himself to speak . `` Well I want to speak to the king . And make sure it 's in his name . '' <newline> <newline> It should n't be that hard for the boy , just ask him to the king . Now , in his anger , one small step from being caught , he had to make sure it was in the king 's name . He knew he should be careful , so he chose to leave it alone . <newline> <newline> He had just moved through an open courtyard , a small cave on the right side of the mountain . The only way in was a cave , but in the past the tunnel would have been blocked by a large boulder , that had been carved into a small mountain pass . The path was long and arduous , though well carved and carved , it offered no shortcuts around the mountain pass . <newline> <newline> He walked to the end of the cave and stood at a small pile of rock , not big enough for him . <newline> <newline> The mountain had not been carved for miles , he noted . There could not be any stone there which made up an entire cavern . There was simply stone . Yet there were two . And they were all as large as a man . <newline> <newline> The boy stood up . He reached for the nearest bolt on his back . As soon as he touched it , it leapt up as well , sending him spinning . But it was too fast to catch him and the rock was already free . When he had returned to the light , the boy would tell everyone and they 'd be impressed . For a time . He had never bothered telling anyone except himself and his family . <newline> <newline> And the gods , a strange pair of deities , would be pleased , for the first time in years . <newline> <newline> He stood back up . <newline> <newline> It was still dark , but he could hear the wind whistling through the air . The smell of cinnamon and cloves filled his nostrils . He did not care for the smell , for only then did he feel his eyes grow wide . <newline> <newline> He ran down the path , a small sloping mound of dirt and branches . He saw one little branch that he followed , up a steep branch . He did not make a noise as to not be noticed . <newline> <newline> One of the trees in the distance was broken , he could not see anything else . <newline> <newline> He climbed on to another branch - this one with a little thorny roots protruding from it 's bark . His toes dug into the bark , which dug into his bones . His knuckles were getting cold , and for one brief moment he thought that the only comfort he had would be the warmth of the frostbite . <newline> <newline> He reached the top of the branch , and the branch grew . It was a little bit thicker than before , but it kept stretching . He looked up and saw several people walking down the path . <newline> <newline> Before him was a man . He did not say a word to his fellow man . <newline> <newline> He looked across the water , and saw that they were all naked . He looked around , but they had all had water as well , and he could not help but get carried away . <newline> <newline> His clothes were not his choice , but he chose to go to them naked . But he did not know what to expect , so he walked alone . He
