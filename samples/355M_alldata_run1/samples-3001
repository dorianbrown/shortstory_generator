They made his job simple by being too cowardly to call something when they were out of bullets . For their troubles he kept them safe . <newline> <newline> It took him years to come to terms with the notion that he was the only one among the other mercenaries with such pride in his family . <newline> <newline> All the rest wanted revenge , for some kind of crime . The first ones were easy to take the lives of when they were young and reckless enough to do something they did not think they needed to do . Forcing the rest to take that kind of fate was too much . He was the only one to hold onto the line . <newline> <newline> He was the only one to understand what they were doing , for all their sins , for all their lies , for all the damage they were causing . As a hero , he carried out an act of mercy for all the people he came across . He protected the people he was supposed to , but in his heart he knew he was leaving them the most he ever could . <newline> <newline> And he had given them a reason to do this . The reason he did it in the first place , a true desire to keep each person alive . He had killed for justice .

It was a shame I had not checked the device to see if the machine had been turned on for hours .
