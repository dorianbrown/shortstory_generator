======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 closet , she had a small hand on her heart that was going to make her sick the next day â€“ this was no good . It was not fair to a person she loved , or a child she had only a few years of experience with whom I could make any contact.

[WP] She was a beautiful girl , and a young girl who seemed only to take a nectar of love for granted , until a little bit later , she saw her mom come in and tell her she could help her mom clean up . She could nan't stop doing it , and did it anyway . ' ''

[WP] Oh , I was going to get a better therapist , but it was time for her to get one , which was coming one day , and after getting my phone from the house , she dialed the number . I had no clue as to what she meant , and in fact , I was about to do a stupid thing I knew would ruin the whole thing , however , and so I called and found her in the bathroom. After checking to make sure it was ok , I found her and made the call , I started crying but had to pull my tears away to do something else , this time in the kitchen . She said she had been told I was on a waiting list , which seemed to have been a mistake , then at that moment , she said , ' I got off the wait list and I can do this , ' and then she had the phone , which was a really nice idea , I went to the bathroom to get a washcloth done , and it was just the right colour , I wanted to go in to go to the wash ' and if I got too many washcloths of color , I would be going too , it gave me plenty of time to dry my teeth , or , no , there was one bathroom in the whole house and all I could do was go by , but I could just go in and go out there , I thought . '' ' So I did it , the washing machine got me done , then my dad called and he got me through his room , and his dad looked right at me , his face was a big red , he looked over and said , '' You know you should go do this , I hope you got out of here too , but right now , here are n't all the girls ready for therapy ! , '' I looked over , and the bathroom door was going to be closed , and then the door got pulled , and I got in my shower and did my best to go , but I could tell it was over , ' I went for it , I was really scared ' , ' ' , ' , ' I did n't know what I was going to do in the bathroom , but I got through it , and my dad was with me next , and the bathroom door was closed , I was really scared . And then my dad called , who was talking for me , '' I just , I did n't know , I just , I did n't , '' So I thought I should make the call . I did n't know . I was just about to give him the call when he picked up a call , telling him that I was getting to get a new one , so he gave me the call , and he told me he had a job that day , and I called and he said , '' I ' ll work for you later , ' ' ' '' What 's your job ? '' Well I called and they are both there , and I looked out the window , and I see my job is in my basement , and one of my rooms is a bed , the other a drawer , and it has an old toilet paper drawer underneath , and I said hey ... '' Well wait , I ' ll work for n't , ' ' , ' ' what ? '' '' '' Just ' n't , '' '' '' '' '' '' No need , I said , '' ' '' '' '' '' ''WP|WP|WP|WP|WP|WP|WP|WP|WP|WP|WP|WP|WP|WP|WP|WP|WP|WP|WP|WP|WP __________________ Last edited by bwnd_golgo ; 06-[-] 2015-09-30 19:40:57 .
