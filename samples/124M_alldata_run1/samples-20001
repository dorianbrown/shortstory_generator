'' <newline> <newline> `` He said that if there were any problems with being a kid like you would probably be trying to get a job . '' <newline> <newline> He looked at me intently . `` What . *Do*- '' <newline> <newline> `` He 's trying hard , you see ? '' <newline> <newline> `` I 'm thinking you should go to college . '' <newline> <newline> `` ... .you think your a kid ? '' <newline> <newline> `` I know . I 'd go on some of my own thing . '' <newline> <newline> The doctor sighed . `` That 's the point , right ? You know it can sometimes get pretty hard to think of 'sitting a kid , huh ' . '' <newline> <newline> `` Yeah . I guess . Not like the real kids . '' <newline> <newline> -- -- -- -- -- -- <newline> <newline> *You do n't make good jokes anymore . * <newline> <newline> I think you 're a poor kid .

[WP] A man who can only measure his own emotions is telling his wife to `` be happy with your life . '' <|startoftext|> “ Be happy with your life ... be happy with your life ... ” <newline> <newline> That ’ s what it said . You wanted me to say , all of a sudden , in an instant , that I ’ d never love you less . That you ’ d never love me back . Oh , for fucks sake , it wasn ’ t that bad .
