[WP] The first line of Donnie Darko was , `` You 're the reason no one wants to hire me , '' which makes for a hilarious moment when translated into the movie . <|startoftext|> `` Why wo n't somebody hire you ? ! You 're the reason no one wants to hire me ! '' This is where the novel was going . That was n't to say he was n't trying to say it . He did n't see it in the movie . It was more or less a line of dialogue , so it 'll sound a bit awkward . <newline> <newline> It was n't really worth the effort and effort it 's going to take , if it is n't actually the case . <newline> <newline> You 're not going to be very appealing to the masses either . What people see is so different than what they see , and they 're going to think people like that story . <newline> <newline> But we need you . We need you because you 're a story . Your readers are going to read other stories more . Your next novel will be even more important than the others . <newline> <newline> You need a story . The most important thing is that YOU write the story . You will read other stories , because it will be so important for YOU to say , `` Hey , come on over to my shop in a couple days and buy the latest book ? You 've got some great stories planned out for the year . You 're gon na have a great time ! '' <newline> <newline> What you need most is you 're a writer , and you 're a liar if you lie . <|endoftext|>

'' <newline> <newline> Peter shrugged , still confused . <newline> <newline> `` No , it 's a mistake ? '' He asked . <newline> <newline> `` No . '' <newline> <newline> He felt the same way about the plan . It had been months of work , and the end result was a doomed and barren Australia . And the end result had been a group of friends , to some extent . <newline> <newline> `` We ca n't be that smart . '' He said . <newline> <newline> `` We are smart , yes , '' said Tom . <newline> <newline> `` How is it possible that these people are even here for this long ? '' He asked . They 'd been living in this forest for three years , and each time they passed this bridge they lost a little more . They knew , deep in their hearts , what was coming . <newline> <newline> `` Oh , it 's a big myth , really . Everyone else tells us they 're just mythological or something . But it 's true , really . Every other civilization has long ago come to this place , because they wanted what we have . These legends are true because we have the same goal , we 're all willing to fight . That we believe in our country , all of us , as a nation . '' <newline> <newline> Tom shook his head . `` But it 's no surprise we 're all here when all of them are lying around .

You are to sit at a chair , put your arms around your own head , and take deep breaths . <newline> <newline> I did as my parent commanded and placed myself over the edge of the chair . I was given no choice but to sit still . It was the most disturbing experience of my existence . The same world had been passed down my mouth and hand that first day , but that world I saw for once and with each breath this time that same world was taken from me . <newline> <newline> I did n't know what to expect , and did n't really have any choice to choose to where we would go
