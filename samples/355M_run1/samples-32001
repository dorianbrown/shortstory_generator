 I would probably be a super villain . <newline> <newline> I 'm not that sure I can be a hero . I 'm just that good at it . <newline> <newline> The doctor in there says I should go see the psychologist to learn my powers . If I learn what I 'll be good at , then maybe I can become the next Doctor Who . <|endoftext|>
[WP] You are the only one left on Earth who can speak to the dead , only you can hear their last words so speak what say they . Today is your first day on planet earth and you will be asked to reveal the meaning of life to a world which has seen unimaginable disaster and destruction . <|startoftext|> `` It was not the most efficient way , she was n't a very pleasant human , she was n't anything but a bitch to talk to . She was a bitch to talk to . Not a bad person , but a bitch to talk to . She was always talking about that bitch , that bitch , that asshole that is out there . The bitch , always talking about it . `` Do n't she realise we were all so lucky ? Do n't she realise we only had a chance ; the chance to make it the same way as her did ? That we just gave up and that we could n't be better than her . That we could n't have been more *together* ? But the fuck is the problem with her ?

This world is a cruel and hateful world , and her words echo down on every building . Every cell in every square inch of flesh . Every single cell in every square inch of space , so much destruction wrought upon it by those who have chosen to use her words too easily , and then what is the best way to make it right again ? <newline> <newline> That 's why you are here , the only survivor .

As your last words echo in the air around me , you will be remembered by many a generation , and in the history books . Your family will remember you forever .

One , go back to your childhood and try to come up with a life plan . Or two , take a moment of your time , leave the planet , and try to lead this world better than anybody else .

'' The crowd echoed with a chorus of groans . <newline> <newline> `` That may be selfish , but we must move forward together . And together we will continue to make sure that future generations could do better . Do n't be so sure yet , but we must continue onward . We 've done great on our own so far , but we have also done nothing on the back-up . But you may have made it and have a new future . Let us hope you find this way , that future where we take you . '' <newline> <newline> The crowd clapped and cheered once again . <newline> <newline> `` Now , my fellow progenitors , I believe we are ready to go forward . To the very beginning of this universe .

[WP] You can see their eyes whenever you look out of the window <|startoftext|> The light of the streetlights seemed to dim more and more . The sky was no longer the beautiful blue of summer . It was not so bright that it was not the colour of the sun either , and yet it was still like the sun . The light of the street lamps seemed to dim even more .
