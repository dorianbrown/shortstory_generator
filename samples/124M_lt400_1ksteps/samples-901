======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 'start with the most fundamental rule of all : do n't ask your mommy if a child is in danger '' , she insisted . <newline> <newline> This rule was a common thing for other people to follow , but it was the only thing that they could never understand about us , at least not until we had lived through it . In the end , it led to us becoming what was left of us in the first place , the little ones . We were our own little creature , we were the ones that had been left . And you see , what was left was the most basic things in our lives : the simplest things , the tiny things that made everything tick from the floor to the refrigerator to the breadboards to the table , and everything else . Every time we tried to move , there was always this small thing called the little thing , that gave us enough of an idea that we could change those things without our parents ever noticing . <newline> <newline> The little things , the little creatures , the little creatures that we had to be scared of . <newline> <newline> In those last moments , as the little beings , the little ones took the lead of our lives . And they did something we didn : they took charge . <newline> <|endoftext|>
[WP] Write the worst possible thing that you can , but never really say . <|startoftext|> So I do n't know what the world 's worst idea is . I have no idea . I could n't even think of anything . <newline> <newline> I just feel it , though I know what the world 's worst idea is , how it might make me want some things I already hate or want but could n't get the time to think of . I have no idea . It 's not like anyone really wants me to ever get into this or that , no you could say . It 's just ... it 's in your mind . <newline> <newline> And you know what ? It 's not like anybody really wants it , it 's just ... it 's in my head . <newline> <newline> *If you need some ideas , here 's a place to start* Yeah I think . It 's definitely just there . And you know what that means ? I do n't think ... it 's right in your mind . <newline> <newline> *You 'd better go on for some stories to tell . * 'Really ? Okay . Just go to the subreddit ! : ) ' <newline> <|endoftext|>
[WP] A person is being given a book , that they must write their own piece . What books do you write ? <|startoftext|> I hate to break this , but they 're just some random random person on a very random earth who just wants to start a world . Maybe that 's why I wrote this . Maybe I 'm not even that guy . Maybe I 'm just too lazy to write all those things right . I do n't know . There 's something *wrong* with me . I 'm stuck in a way where I have every word in my mouth at once and when I stop for a second I feel like I 'm actually writing this . It 's just ... this , this , this stuff I think I 've been waiting for . They think it 's a waste of time . They just stop , and I 'm just *that guy . That guy . That guy . <newline> <newline> I guess some are calling me weird/mythologizing a lot of things out of their face , but not a lot . Their opinion is all wrong , as a matter of fact . Like I 've never gotten up from a book so I have no idea who I 'm supposed to be reading it with . Just my *book . * So ... . What 's wrong with me ? They might think I 'm crazy , and think it 's a waste of paper . What 's wrong with me ? Well if you keep writing this piece for myself I 'll just stop . I will no longer be a writer and I 'll get fired . I do n't care about others . I will become a writer and I WILL . So just please ... please , just keep writing . I think I 'll stop then . Or at least not even start . <|endoftext|>
[WP] The universe is now a single story . <|startoftext|> The end of the story . The End of all stories . The story where everyone ends , but you decide to end it , and you decide to change the flow of things by doing what they say it do . You think maybe you only do what they say it do is the right thing to do , but that 's not true . I 'm just saying that
