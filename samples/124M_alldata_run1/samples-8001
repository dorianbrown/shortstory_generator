 . The one who had a choice . <newline> <newline> `` My dear , it is not the woman who chooses to follow your example . '' Dr. Kallist said matter-of-factly . `` It 's the woman who sees your face , and you can tell that it does n't matter . You can , but that does n't mean you will , '' he continued . `` I , Dr. Kallist , have a choice here . You can not do what the woman said . '' <newline> <newline> I did n't hear Dr. Kauss say this . That was before the world reached a boiling point , and Dr. Kallist and the Doctor did n't even look directly at me , which I found hilarious and disturbing . They , by the way , had their own personal demons . <newline> <newline> `` I , as a doctor , do n't know why I have an enemy , but here , in the future , with all the people in the world , I can not do what the woman said . '' We shared so much in this short conversation , and the woman had a point . It really was n't something I wanted to be doing , but I was n't sure how the world even had such an enemy , or why anyone was going to care . <newline> <newline> `` Oh , you will know soon . '' The doctor nodded slowly to the woman as he stared her in the face . <newline> <newline> I turned away , looking at the doctor , who 's face was blank , and continued forward . `` As the world grew smaller and smaller , it became clear that there was no one who could make any difference in the end . Now I am the only one in the world with hope and hope that the end does n't come , but rather , it does n't , '' he said , looking a few moments longer . `` For all our faults , we found a way to make that happen . '' <newline> <newline> The woman did n't say anything more . <|endoftext|>
[ TT ] Write about anything as if it were Shakespearean . <|startoftext|> So it is then that we sit upon a table with those two words , “ I don ’ t know . I don ’ t want to be here. ” The table that lay at my feet was not empty , it was more like the corner of a very long corridor for the two of us . We were in this room . My head was spinning . I didn ’ t know why I was there or what I was about to do . I didn ’ t know what to say . I had no idea what to do . <newline> <newline> It wasn ’ t a time for me to do anything , there was no need to take anything from , either . But it had been this last time that I felt the heat . I turned to face my room where I knew the room was occupied . As I turned I realized that the bed was mine , my chair had a similar shape to mine and I couldn ’ t stop my hands from running over to get it . <newline> <newline> My hands ran across the thin mattress and down to my chest , my heart racing in a rhythmic motion . My chest was almost bursting with pain , there was nothing else to hold down . My muscles were nagging , my head was pounding . I couldn ’ t think how we had gotten here . Then I felt the pain . I felt my head drop . There was no more to do . <newline> <newline> There was a second pulse and then he was gone , I felt a pulse , it was not me but the bed that I was in and the floor . The floor . Where we had stood . <newline> <newline> “ I don ’ t know. ” I say as I lay down next to him to rest my head . He stares at me , eyes heavy . I ’ m almost falling from my bed . <newline> <newline> I can feel my heart beating in my chest as I struggle to keep my eyes away from the floor . My chest . A crack . I hear the noise of the floor . It is louder than I thought . It is the only sound of the room . No more . There is only me and him . But I have no power over him . There is no more there then I have ever felt . <newline> <newline> And now I ’ m still here . I have no power over him . He is mine , but a second pulse , I feel his pulse . <newline> <newline> The noise ends and I find myself falling forward into darkness . For what seems like the long time I ’ ve been here . I can feel the pain on my body as I
