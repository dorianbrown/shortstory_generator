 would be to me. He'd have given you a hand on the road for me - not a chance to say thank you ever so lightly or for the fact that you were so slow to start up that night. He would be all over the place now but you'd still get to hear the sounds of the beat, the wind, the gentle rocking and crunch of leaves dancing in the leaves on the ground. Just the one person he called a friend, but the other people only had your name imprinted on them. <newline> <newline> That boy's the man with the hat. Just his hat. <newline> <newline> The boy had his hat, just a simple grey one. The boy is like someone with colour just out of place now. He'd just have to use it to keep an eye on every inch of the driveway. He'd have to use it for keeping watch on people, to keep the house, everything in its place to the same people. He'd get bored and he'd take off his hat and put on an appropriate pair to wear. <newline> <newline> "My God, man," the boy said under his breath as he walked through the lawn. <newline> <newline> "You know it just can't really do so anymore," the man said as he turned towards the boy. <newline> <newline> "Yes, I do. It doesn't do that much anyway. But you can change it," the man said as he looked back. <newline> <newline> "Is it going to be so bad?" the man asked as he walked through the door with his hat on and his hand out towards the boy. <newline> <newline> "No," said the girl's face. <newline> <newline> "It'll be fine, right? "the man said as he gave his old hat a smile as he walked in. <newline> <newline> "You don't need to think about it. You can use the hat for what you need. It's not cheap, not a very expensive hat but no matter what you want, it will come with its special features." the man said as he walked in the door. <newline> <newline> And then the man opened the door. It did not look any better than anything he'd ever seen, except that you could not get your hat off without it. <|endoftext|>
[WP] You have been hired to kill Hitler . <|startoftext|> "I know." <newline> <newline> "It is a pleasure to work alongside you." <newline> <newline> "That is correct, Mr. President". <newline> <newline> <newline> "The pleasure of being entrusted to... the honor of... the life of Adolf Hitler". <newline> <newline> "Of course, Adolf. Please do not hesitate to kill him." <newline> <newline> "This is impossible. Please do not hesitate. That is our duty to the world. It is not my duty to kill Hitler. I merely wish to help him. If you could kill him, would you?" <newline> <newline> "I hope so..." Hitler mumbled as his speech began to fade. "If you could not kill Hitler, who would? Would you like to? Who would you kill?" <newline> <newline> "He must die." Hitler said, "I did it all myself. I killed him!" He screamed as he reached his hand into his lap. <newline> <newline> "How does that work? What do you do?" Hitler shouted as he reached down and touched his hand. <newline> <newline> "If you are ready." Hitler said before he vanished from the podium. <newline> <newline> <newline> *You will die. * <|endoftext|>
[WP] The year is 2014 , and people are getting their first VR experience with VR goggles ... But this is all a dream in and of itself <|startoftext|> It was bright, and the world spun slowly into a blur. The clouds above us swayed, and as we rose to our feet, I noticed my brother's shoes, both in the morning and in the evening. It was nice though, considering that many people had already bought the goggles from me. A few hours before the flight it seemed we were flying to Berlin. I heard the faintest of footsteps in the car, and looked down at my shoes. <newline> <newline> It was the third day I was on my way.
