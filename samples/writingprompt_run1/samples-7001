======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 cause a single tear to the back of my head . Just another time they would take me by the throat , when my parents did n't care for me . Just another one . I could n't breathe . <newline> <newline> I thought I was safe . <newline> <newline> `` The only thing we want is this to be over . '' <newline> <newline> I stood up and walked to the chair opposite mine , and my fingers did n't have the strength to wrap my head around the words . My hands did n't feel the need to hold them steady though . I did n't know what was coming . Everything else went numb . I could hardly control what I 'd done right now . <newline> <newline> They would n't have let me go if I had a chance either . <newline> <newline> This was an eternity without being safe . <newline> <newline> `` It 's done '' I said , as quiet as possible . `` The next time I see you 'll be this last . All I said was this . '' <newline> <newline> A tear fell from the back of my head . I started to move , but it took me a moment to bring my head up . My mind was not in the right place . Everything was moving but I could n't move , so I held it up and kept looking at the ground , hoping to pull it free . Nothing . <newline> <newline> But I could n't . My hand was n't on the ground . It was on the ground , just on the ground , waiting for it to leave . A moment later , I was standing on a piece of rock that had n't been there in five seconds , and suddenly I noticed something . My hand was on the ground . The next thing I noticed were the shoes on top of the rock . It was on their heels . I started walking towards the other pieces of rock to the right , and the shoes were on top , just on the toes . One shoe sat on top . But nothing else , my hand was on the ground . There was nothing else left to grab from the ground . I walked back to the edge of the rock , but could n't move . This was the fifth time the hands could n't move . There had been no previous time of this . <newline> <newline> I heard my voice . I could n't stop , not right now . They were right , after all . <|endoftext|>
[WP] The human body moves from body to body in just a few moments . <|startoftext|> The muscles were still there but that did n't give them away - the muscle mass was the same . I started to cry , but before I could do so the muscles around me pulled me down . <newline> <newline> No - not this time ! I was n't so close yet , just close enough that I was n't in the womb of my mother . <newline> <newline> I knew now that I was n't ready for this , that I would n't be allowed to finish this before I passed . My hands felt numb and I felt the tears running down my cheeks . I felt a terrible feeling in my heart . <newline> <newline> I did n't think about it too much , but I got to go . <newline> <newline> I felt the heat of my life on the inside of me and I did n't think about it much , but I felt that we 'd done this many times before , so this thought did it 's job . <newline> <newline> It took me a month to get there and I still was n't ready for this . But still , I could n't stop weeping as I walked . <newline> <newline> As I walked , my mind wandered . My body did n't seem to have moved very well in me , though it was n't as strong as it used to . I tried to cry out but my throat was tight and I could n't breathe . My eyes were still closed , and I was n't seeing the tears I had left before . <newline> <newline> It was then that I realised that my body lay on the floor and my mind had shifted . It was still there , but my mind could no longer be processed and processing itself was n't possible anymore . <newline> <newline> I thought that my body , my very essence , was gone . I could n't function , could n't breathe . My lungs were shutting down . I felt sick , nauseous and was n't sure why . But then I remembered to move my hands away from my body . I did so and my lungs had shut down . <newline> <newline> Then I heard my phone ring again . <newline
