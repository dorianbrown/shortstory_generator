[WP] Everyone , of course , is born with a superpower . They gain one on being born with that superpower on the first day of their life .

What if I can get to become an immortal?" <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> * ( The narrator is already talking to me, and I feel stupid doing this and I'm getting the hint. ) * <newline> <newline> *** <newline> <newline> *This story will be written by a male, and has no gender implications. * I wrote this in my first day of college so sorry for grammar and everything.
