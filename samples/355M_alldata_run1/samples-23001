[WP] A time traveler loses their mind while traveling , but find themselves back at the beginning of time . <|startoftext|> When he lost his mind , his wife and daughter all came to him . <newline> <newline> They said goodbye , but the man who lived the last time around tried to be as kind as he could . `` There 's no time like the present , my dear old friend , I 'm going to miss you . '' <newline> <newline> He left his wife and child , crying with joy . <newline> <newline> After three months , he returned , still in the shape of a giant man in a blue suit . He came to know them all . What he has always dreamed of the most , and the most feared , and the most lost . <newline> <newline> On his way home , he found his own time and place . <newline> <newline> All he has ever seen and heard was the sound of the clock ticking away . <newline> <newline> Before he knew it , the world felt like a big , empty room , but the man did not want to be out of it . <newline> <newline> Then , to his surprise , the clocks never set . <newline> <newline> The clock went backwards . Then there was the sound of children laughing , and a mother telling her own story of her husband 's passing . <newline> <newline> Before he saw his wife , she seemed fine . <newline> <newline> After a few more minutes , he got to his senses . <newline> <newline> `` H-hey , '' he mumbled . `` That was crazy , '' he thought . `` How about I keep hearing some of my own version of 'The Simpsons ' ? ! '' <newline> <newline> He finally got to the end of his time . <newline> <newline> *Gods , I have some work to do . * his thoughts were filled with questions . Then , in a rush , he started on his next question . But , instead of `` what is the number ? '' he asked . <newline> <newline> `` A . 1 or 2 , '' the clock told him . <newline> <newline> `` A^2 ? , '' he asked . <newline> <newline> `` A^2^2^4 . '' <newline> <newline> `` A^4^3 , '' he said . `` A^4^3^2^11 ? Do the numbers ever seem confusing , or do you miss your old job ? '' <newline> <newline> `` A^3^4 , '' the clock said . The clock looked at him . `` If you could come back to the time to tell me that now , your job , you 'd be in charge of a bigger one . '' <newline> <newline> `` What , you can not tell my bosses who is going to do the job ? ! '' he asked . `` It 's a small business and they 're just waiting on the numbers . '' <newline> <newline> The clock stopped moving and there was the usual feeling of a clock that stopped its rotation . <newline> <newline> `` What about the clock , '' he asked . The clock looked at him , and he had the feeling that he 'd found himself in a dream . <newline> <newline> `` Your job , '' the clock said again , in an echoing voice . `` Your job is to make a clock that stops ticking . You do n't get time to do it . '' <newline> <newline> The clock looked at each of the clock , then at the clock . <newline> <newline> `` And what 's the point of ticking ? '' <newline> <newline> Suddenly , the clock spoke . *It 's your job , * the clock thought . <newline> <newline> `` For eternity , '' it said . <newline> <newline> *There 's more time for us . * <newline> <|endoftext|>
