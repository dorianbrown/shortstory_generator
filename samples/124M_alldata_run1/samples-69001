line> `` What 're you looking for anyway ? '' Harry asked as he approached . <newline> <newline> `` They call me 'The Boy Who Loved Magic ' <newline> They 've always liked to believe I have magic '' the boy said . <newline> <newline> `` Why do their lies ? What could they possibly have known ? I 'm not a wizard . And it does n't make sense . '' I said finally turning my back on the wizard . <newline> <newline> `` You see , there 's this old wizard who I am sure has knowledge about this place and knows that we are here . He told me that some people , the ones in the shadows , they were able to access the magic I use and manipulate things for us . They claimed that the old wizard was the source of all our magic . '' said the boy . <newline> <newline> `` He claims that no magic exists , he 's been dead a long time and that some of these wizards can still hold knowledge from the world with magic . How can magic even exist if he is dead ? '' I said . `` How can I be sure I 've been dead forever because I am one who can control magic ? Are your theories just that ridiculous ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Yes . It 's true . I like to think that magic existed long before you took your wand , but no matter how much I take , the fact is it was all magic .

[WP] At age 18 , you are able to trade in a percentage of your physical beauty for an equivalent amount of intelligence , or vice versa . <|startoftext|> My brothers in arms will always come to me , looking down at their hands , wondering why I never showed them my eyes , my smile , their eyes glistening with something new . They might not see them yet , I don ’ t see them much , so they rarely show themselves . My face , though , they all have a face . They ’ re the same face with the same cheekbones , the same jawline , perfect teeth , the same nose , but mine . I take this face day after day , looking out for them , every day , until my parents die , I see them every day , it doesn ’ t matter . The days become weeks , each one just another day , a gift for me , a second eye that takes care of all my worries , they always give it to me , for free . But for them , every day is another day , another day that I have to pretend like I ’ m okay , pretending I is happy , pretending that I can be in the good life , that I can go on living like I want to and be like my brothers and sisters , pretend I can go on to lead our lives , to be the good men and women that we were intended to be , pretend that I am better , pretending that I have the brains to lead the lives that will make us great men. ” <newline> <newline> <newline> My mothers eyes are now mine , it ’ s sad , sad that they don ’ t remember their parents , only look at myself , as a man , but as an ugly ugly child , but I feel this way , I feel like they don ’ t care <newline> <newline> `` I see you ’ ve gone away for today , why do you keep this up ? I won ’ t take you away from me again ! '' <newline> `` A man , I am not a man , I am a man , I am not a man , I am a man , I ’ m a man '' <newline> <newline> But the man doesn ’ t see me , he must not . No , I must be a man , the man sees me everyday , every moment he can be me , he is not me , he is not like my mother . <newline> <newline> `` He does that every day , he has this strange look to him , looks like he is smiling , but he looks different . He feels strange , even if he does n't feel normal . He looks sad , sad , sad . It is like he is living under a different person . It is sad , sad , sad , just to show these strange feelings . I can tell he does that every day , but he is not happy , he is sad , he is sad , sad . But I can hear his thoughts , I can feel them and I
