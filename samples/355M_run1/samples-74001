 of them . All she knows is I ca n't see her , and that she had been taken in by a gang of people . I 'm not even sure why she took me in . My name is n't Kelly anymore , I just found out what those fuckers did to me . <newline> <newline> It 's not that they were bad people ; really , they were a bunch of savages ; nothing had ever gone their way before . The thing that finally made their days of life interesting was the way I felt ; it was something that really bothered them . After being told to take the place of Kelly , everything became just easier for them . <newline> <newline> The gang consisted of the gang of people that were me . At the same times , I was at their front door and they could n't leave without taking something . When I would walk them out of the house , there was a lot of yelling and crying as the gang dragged me out the front door . My thoughts were racing after being taken ; how they would feel no longer knowing that she took me away , and that it had to take place with her . After years of being abused , I could n't bring myself to give up something so important . She felt as though , that the people that were taking her from her life had a purpose ; and something like that was too for her to handle . She went off on a tirade about how she had to find her own place in her life . How if she did n't take this as a punishment , would it do anything to her ? And to think what would she do to everyone else who did n't know the importance of what she could give to her ? <newline> <newline> In the process , they had her put in the care of the group , and who was going to miss her ? A few of the guys had been in the gang of people long enough for me to get an idea ; so what if a girl were to be taken away from me without so much as a fight ? <newline> <newline> I took a step forward , hoping that they would stop , and for me to leave . But then my mind went blank , and they gave her away for me . <newline> <newline> A few months were spent alone on the streets , and they decided that it was time to take me back . So I stayed away from that place . It was beautiful , the sight of me filled me with awe , and a longing for her that came from the heart ; an ever so powerful and strong feeling . <newline> <newline> One day , I was walking in a park , and I saw her . That 's when I really saw her . I saw a face that I had not seen before and I saw a face that I did n't know I had not been that familiar with . I saw a face that made my heart melt , I saw the face that would be mine , forever . And the first thing she said to me ; <newline> `` Good night Kelly . '' <|endoftext|>
