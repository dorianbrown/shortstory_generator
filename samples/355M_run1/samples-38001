 remains the same . <newline> <newline> But the man that he had been with was not the man I saw myself as . <newline> <newline> I was at home . <|endoftext|>
[WP] You 're a member of a time-travel `team` . You have been hired to assassinate your ~future self , however you have no idea where you are now . <|startoftext|> I am no stranger to these kinds of situations . The problem is that I will never be able to remember this meeting . We were at the beach , after all <newline> <newline> `` This could n't be . '' the other man said as he stared out over the bay <newline> <newline> `` Aye , and it sure as hell could n't be . '' I replied , and turned my head around . A man in a trenchcoat , who I now knew was a high-class assassin , stood about a meter from me . <newline> <newline> `` No , you got ta tell me . '' <newline> <newline> `` What ? I am not an assassin myself , but I have never gotten a chance to meet a professional before . '' I looked around nervously . The man did not look friendly . `` I mean , you know ... it was you who went in first , right ? '' <newline> <newline> `` It was your choice , you know . '' He said , a little nervously <newline> <newline> `` What ? What did you say ? '' I stood up now , my posture still straight and confident . `` You 've done the whole thing right ? Are you saying this is not *my* time ? Or am I *supposed* to be in control ? '' <newline> <newline> Now it was me , he was standing behind the back wall , staring at me . The other guy could n't tell in his head what I was saying . He stood to the side of the other sniper . <newline> <newline> `` Tell me , '' he said , but I did n't stop , I was n't supposed to stay quiet , *not like he could understand me , * so I slowly spoke <newline> <newline> `` I thought about it a few times . You know , I thought maybe this would be an ideal setting , we 'd all be happy , together , right ? I did . So I went back ! I did n't think about it . I went back to the city , to you , you to I . We talked . I know you wo n't be here . I can tell you I 'm sorry , because no one ever is . But I would n't have wanted to see this happen , if my time had come sooner . '' <newline> <newline> I did n't need to look up at the sniper ; he had always looked up as well , even more so when I looked back , he was staring at me with pity . `` This is n't what I expected . '' I said , trying to sound as if I were not still in a state of shock , and just that I was . He reached out to shake my hand . <newline> <newline> `` I 'm sorry . I just wanted to say thank you . Thank you for coming with us . '' <newline> <newline> `` Well , you never expected to hear that from me , did you ? It 's going to be hard for me , too . '' he said , trying to laugh so that I felt no emotion at all . `` Maybe we should just say farewell , huh ? '' <newline> <newline> His voice was rough , and when you felt that , you knew this was n't going to go anywhere . `` I guess , '' he said , putting his hand on mine `` you never thought I knew you were alive . '' <newline> <newline> I did n't really want to say much , I always knew I could use a good time . He looked me up and down , trying to find my secret . <newline> <newline> `` You know , I was n't expecting you to be my friend ; but it 's really hard to trust these guys now . What if it becomes too dangerous to say goodbye ? '' He asked , and I did n't even bother to reply . I just had to tell him . <newline> <newline> He smiled , and I was glad he did . `` I knew you 'd be there . Not many people know someone like me . '' <newline> <newline> `` So , '' he said , reaching out his hand `` tell me now , what do you want me to tell you ? '' <newline> <newline> `` I need you to tell me ... '' <newline> <newline
